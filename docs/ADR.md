## ADR-001: Hybrid OWL+SKOS Modeling Approach

**Date:** 2025-01-07  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** Need to model both formal relationships (OWL) and controlled vocabularies (SKOS) for automated classification systems.

### Decision

We will use a hybrid approach combining OWL and SKOS:

- **OWL classes** for formal relationships and structural entities (events, measurements, stocks)
- **SKOS concepts** for controlled vocabularies (methods, criteria, status categories)
- **SHACL shapes** for validation rules and automated classification

### Rationale

1. **Operational Focus**: The ontology models operational processes, not biological concepts
2. **Automated Classification**: Need both controlled vocabularies (methods) and rich data modeling (events with metadata)
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Methods as vocabulary terms, events as data carriers
4. **Industry Standards**: Aligns with OBO Foundry principles and community practices

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Supports manual estimate type assignment (Hyatt 1997 framework) - automated classification deferred to post-MVP
- Supports both human-readable vocabularies and machine-processable relationships
- Aligns with existing salmon data management practices
- Facilitates data quality validation through SHACL rules

**Negative:**

- Increased complexity compared to pure OWL approach
- Requires understanding of both OWL and SKOS modeling patterns
- Potential confusion between OWL classes and SKOS concepts

### Implementation

- SKOS schemes for enumeration methods, estimate methods, downgrade criteria, and status categories
- OWL classes for survey events, measurements, and organizational structures
- SHACL shapes for method-specific validation and automated type assignment

## ADR-002: Darwin Core Integration Strategy

**Date:** 2025-01-07  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** Need for international interoperability with biodiversity data systems (GBIF, OBIS).

### Decision

We will align with Darwin Core (DwC) as the top-level framework:

- Extend DwC classes (`dwc:Event`, `dwc:Organism`, `dwc:MeasurementOrFact`)
- Use DwC predicates where applicable (`dwc:samplingProtocol`, `dwc:eventDate`)
- Maintain DFO-specific extensions for salmon management concepts

### Rationale

1. **International Interoperability**: Enables data sharing with GBIF, OBIS, and other biodiversity platforms
2. **Community Standards**: Darwin Core is widely adopted in biodiversity informatics
3. **Future-Proofing**: Builds on stable, well-tested standards
4. **Data Discovery**: Makes DFO salmon data discoverable globally

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Enables international data sharing and discovery
- Leverages existing DwC infrastructure and tools
- Provides standard predicates for common relationships
- Supports integration with global biodiversity databases

**Negative:**

- Some DwC concepts may not perfectly fit salmon management needs
- Requires careful mapping of DFO-specific concepts to DwC framework
- Potential tension between DwC simplicity and DFO complexity requirements

### Implementation

- DFO classes extend appropriate DwC classes via `rdfs:subClassOf`
- Use DwC predicates for standard relationships (dates, protocols, measurements)
- Maintain DFO-specific properties for domain-specific concepts

## ADR-003: Single File vs Modular Ontology Structure

**Date:** 2025-01-07  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** Need to balance simplicity with maintainability for ontology development.

### Decision

We will start with a single ontology file (`dfo-salmon.ttl`) with potential for future modularization:

- **Current**: One file containing all schema elements
- **Future**: May split into modules (stock, genetics, governance) as complexity grows
- **Shapes**: Separate SHACL shapes in `ontology/shapes/` directory

### Rationale

1. **Simplicity First**: Easier for contributors to understand and edit
2. **OBO Foundry Alignment**: Follows OBO best practices for initial development
3. **Gradual Complexity**: Can modularize when the ontology grows large
4. **Tool Compatibility**: Single file works well with existing ontology tools

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Simpler development and maintenance initially
- Easier for new contributors to understand
- Better tool support and validation
- Follows established OBO Foundry patterns

**Negative:**

- May become unwieldy as ontology grows
- Potential for circular dependencies
- Harder to reuse specific modules independently

### Implementation

- Single `ontology/dfo-salmon.ttl` file for all schema elements
- Separate `ontology/shapes/dfo-salmon-shapes.ttl` for SHACL validation
- Clear organization within the single file using comment headers
- Future modularization plan documented in roadmap

## ADR-004: Schema vs Data Separation

**Date:** 2025-01-07  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** Need to maintain clean separation between ontology schema and instance data.

### Decision

We will strictly separate schema and data:

- **Ontology file**: Contains only schema elements (classes, properties, SKOS concepts)
- **Instance data**: Stored in separate files or systems
- **Examples**: Minimal test data in `ontology/examples/` for validation only

### Rationale

1. **Maintainability**: Schema changes independently of data updates
2. **Reusability**: Same schema can be used for multiple datasets
3. **Versioning**: Schema and data can have different versioning cycles
4. **Interoperability**: Other systems can import just the schema

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Clean, focused ontology file
- Easier schema validation and maintenance
- Better separation of concerns
- Enables schema reuse across different datasets

**Negative:**

- Requires discipline to maintain separation
- May need additional tooling for data management
- Potential confusion about where to put certain elements

### Implementation

- `ontology/dfo-salmon.ttl` contains only schema elements
- `ontology/examples/` contains minimal test data for validation
- Instance data stored in separate RDF files or graph databases
- SHACL shapes validate data structure without containing data

## ADR-005: SHACL for Automated Classification

**Date:** 2025-01-07  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** Need for automated estimate type assignment based on survey metadata.

### Decision

We will use SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) for:

- Data validation and quality control
- Manual estimate type assignment (Hyatt 1997 framework) - automated classification deferred to post-MVP
- Method-specific threshold enforcement

### Rationale

1. **Automated Classification**: Enables rule-based estimate type assignment
2. **Data Quality**: Validates survey metadata against method requirements
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps validation logic separate from ontology schema
4. **Industry Standard**: SHACL is a W3C standard for data validation

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Enables automated quality assessment
- Supports method-specific validation rules
- Separates validation logic from schema definition
- Provides clear error messages for data quality issues

**Negative:**

- Additional complexity in ontology development
- Requires understanding of SHACL syntax and patterns
- May need specialized tooling for SHACL validation

### Implementation

- SHACL shapes in `ontology/shapes/dfo-salmon-shapes.ttl`
- Validation rules for survey events and measurements
- Automated type assignment rules based on method-specific thresholds
- Integration with data entry systems for real-time validation

## ADR-007: External Vocabulary Alignment Strategy

**Date:** 2025-01-07  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** Need to align with existing vocabularies while maintaining DFO-specific requirements.

### Decision

We will align with external vocabularies using:

- **Literal IRIs**: Store external vocabulary IRIs as literals (e.g., QUDT units)
- **Object Properties**: Future migration to object properties when appropriate
- **Cross-references**: Use `oboInOwl:hasDbXref` for external alignments

### Rationale

1. **Pragmatic Implementation**: Literal IRIs avoid complex import dependencies
2. **Future Flexibility**: Can migrate to object properties later
