## ðŸ“‹ Scope

This ontology models **operational processes and data structures** for Pacific salmon management at DFO, including:

- **Stock Assessment**: Escapement surveys, measurement protocols, estimate types
- **Genetics/GSI**: Genetic sample analysis, reporting units, composition measurements  
- **Management & Policy**: Conservation status, management units, regulatory compliance
- **Data Stewardship**: Quality control, validation rules, automated classification

**This is NOT a biological domain ontology** about salmon ecology or behavior, but rather an **operational ontology** for data management and integration.
