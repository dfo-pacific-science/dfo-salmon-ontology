ABSTRACT

Limit reference points, LRPs, defne the stock status below which serious harm is expected to
occur to a stock. LRPs are required for major fsh stocks, or Stock Management Units (SMUs)
that are prescribed by regulation under amendments to the Canadian Fisheries Act (2019).
Pacifc salmon are unique among marine fsh stocks due to their high levels of intraspecifc
diversity which gives rise to a large range in data availability, considerations, and approaches
for assessments and LRP development. In this paper, we identify six principles for developing
LRPs for Pacifc salmon that are adapted from principles used more broadly among marine
species. One principle unique to Pacifc salmon is that LRPs should be aligned with Canada’s
Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) objective of preserving biodiversity of salmon at the scale of Conservation
Units (CUs), which are nested within SMUs. We developed methods for calculating LRPs, and
established guidelines on how to implement them including under which conditions they should
or should not be applied. We propose that LRPs be identifed from the proportion of CUs that
have status above the Red zone for WSP status assessments, as a default approach. This
provides some consistency with status assessments already produced under the WSP, and can
inform management decisions for harvest, habitat and hatcheries that often occur at fner, CU
scales. To supplement the default approach, we provide LRPs based on metrics of aggregate
abundances for the entire SMU, which may be required for fsheries management purposes in
some cases. These latter LRPs are derived to have a desired probability of all component CUs
being above Red status given an assumed relationship between aggregate abundance and the
probability that all CUs will be above Red status. We identify uncertainties associated with each
approach, and describe how they can be applied across a range of data types, qualities and
quantities. Analyses to support our development of guidelines has been informed by three cases
studies: Interior Fraser Coho Salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch, West Coast Vancouver Island
Chinook Salmon, O. tshawytscha, and Inside South Coast Chum Salmon, O. keta, excluding
the Fraser River.

INTRODUCTION

1.1.  BACKGROUND

KEY POINTS:

•

The revised Fisheries Act includes new Fish Stocks provisions that introduced legal
obligations to identify limit reference points (LRPs) for major fsh stocks prescribed
under regulation.

•  Under DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework, LRPs defne the stock status below

which serious harm is expected to occur to the stock.

•

•  Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) includes an objective to safeguard the genetic
diversity of wild Pacifc salmon by maintaining and protecting Conservation Units
(CUs), the focus of biological assessments under the WSP.
The revised Fisheries Act indicates that a single LRP is required for each major fsh
stock, defned as Stock Management Units (SMUs) for Pacifc salmon, which are
groups of CUs managed as a unit to achieve joint status.
This provision created the need for the development of methodologies to estimate
LRPs for assessment and management at the SMU level, while considering the need
to maintain CUs within an SMU above their lower benchmarks under the WSP.

•

Amendments to the Canadian Fisheries Act (2019) include new Fish Stocks provisions that
introduce legal obligations to manage stocks to promote sustainability and avoid biological limit
reference points, LRPs (DFO 2021a). The provisions also require plans to rebuild fsh stocks
that have declined to, or below, an LRP while taking into account the biology of the fsh and
environmental conditions experienced by the stock. These obligations apply to major fsh stocks
that are prescribed under regulations. They reinforce the previously established DFO policies to
manage stocks consistent with the precautionary approach. These include The Fishery Decision
Making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach (DFO 2009a), also known as
DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework within the Sustainable Fisheries Framework and
Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy (DFO 2005).

Under DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework, LRPs represent the stock status below which
serious harm is expected to occur to the stock. Defnitions of serious harm within the DFO
literature tend to focus on impaired productivity, although other aspects of serious harm are
sometimes captured (see grey box below, adapted from Marentette et al. (In

)1).

1.1.1. Interpretations of serious harm

Serious harm has been interpreted as any changes to the biological properties of the stock
that make growth or rebuilding to target levels cease to be considered rapid and secure1.
These changes are considered difficult to reverse2,3, and can be associated with:
•

impaired productivity1-6  resulting from changes to biological processes such as
recruitment, growth, maturation and survival1,4;
a loss of resilience5  (an impaired ability to rebuild or to recover from perturbation6);
increased risk of depensation or Allee effects4; and/or

•
•
•  more generally, states where population dynamics cease to be well-understood4.
At this status level, there may also be resultant impacts to the ecosystem, associated
species and a long-term loss of fshing opportunities6. Serious harm may be due to fshing,
other human-induced mortality, or changes in population dynamics unrelated to fshing4.

1(DFO 2016a); 2(Kronlund et al. 2018); 3(Shelton and Rice 2002); 4(DFO 2006); 5(Smith et al. 2012); 6(DFO 2009a)

The defnition of serious harm from DFO (2009a) indicates that LRPs should be above the level
where serious harm is expected to occur, not at the level where it is occurring, and that long-term
losses of fshing opportunities may occur below that l evel. Defning the level before serious harm
occurs to a species or ecosystem is a pervasive challenge as harm is often not identifed until it
is already occurring (Hilborn and Walters 1992) and population dynamics are not well understood
at low population sizes (DFO 2006; Keith and Hutchings 2012). Also, this defnition of serious
harm includes possible impacts on other ecosystem components, which are often challenging
to identify because of limited data and poor understanding of ecosystem linkages and dynamics
(but see Chagaris et al. 2020).

Pacifc salmon are unique among marine fsh species due to their high levels of intraspecifc
diversity which gives rise to a large range in data availability, considerations, and approaches for
assessments and LRP development. These differences necessitate guidance on LRP methods
that is specific to Pacific salmon, while being consistent with the principles for LRP development
across species (Marentette et al. In

).

prep.

Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy, WSP, represents DFO’s implementation of the Precautionary
Approach Framework for Pacifc s almon. The goal of the WSP is to restore and maintain healthy
and diverse salmon populations and their habitats for the beneft and enjoyment of the people of
Canada in perpetuity (DFO 2005). One objective of the WSP is to safeguard the genetic diversity
of wild Pacifc salmon by maintaining and protecting Conservation Units (CUs), where a CU is
defned as a “group of wild salmon suffciently isolated from other groups that, if extirpated is very
unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable time frame, such as a human lifetime or a
specifed number of salmon generations” (DFO 2005).

Genetic and phenotypic diversity among CUs is important because it allows for diversity in
responses to threats and environmental drivers, contributing to the sustainability of the species
and the ecosystem services they provide (Price et al. 2021). Portfolio effects have been shown
to dampen interannual variance in aggregate-level abundances due to independent dynamics
among component populations or CUs (Schindler et al. 2010). Population and life-history diversity
may buffer species from environmental variability and contribute to long-term stability through
differing responses to environmental changes. However, deterioration of portfolio effects have
been observed for Pacifc salmon in Canada due to synchronous declining trends in abundances

2

related to changes in climate and marine and freshwater habitats, as well as fshing practices
that have historically overfshed weak populations (Price et a l. 2021).

Under the WSP, the status of individual CUs is inferred by comparing status indicators to biological
benchmarks delineating three zones: Green, Amber, and Red. These zones represent increasing
conservation concern from Green to Red requiring increasing management intervention. The
lower benchmark, delineating the Red and Amber zones, is intended to be at the level to “ensure
there is a substantial buffer between it and any level of abundance that could lead to a CU being
considered at risk of extinction by COSEWIC”, where COSEWIC is the Committee on the Status
of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (DFO 2005; Holt et al. 2009). In practice, CUs in the WSP Red
zone tend to align with Endangered or Threatened COSEWIC statuses, and Green with Not at
Risk COSEWIC categories.

1.1.2.

Spatial scales of assessment

Salmon have a complex hierarchical populations structure that extends from taxonomic species
to local demes or spawning locations (Fig. 1). CUs are nested within taxonomic species and
major life-history variants, such as ocean- and stream-type for Chinook Salmon, Oncorhynchus
tshawytscha, and populations are nested within CUs (DFO 2005). While assessments of Pacifc
salmon under the WSP has focused on setting benchmarks for individual salmon CUs (DFO
2005), the revised Fisheries Act indicates that a single LRP is required for each major fsh
stock(DFO 2021a). In the context of Pacifc salmon, major fsh stocks are defned as Stock
Management Units (SMUs), which are groups of CUs that are managed as a unit to achieve
joint status (DFO 2021b). The delineation of SMUs was in part a response to the national-level
requirement for delineating major stocks for Pacifc salmon under the Fisheries A ct. This provision
created the need for the development of methodologies to estimate LRPs for the assessment
and management of fsheries at the SMU level, while considering the need to maintain all CUs
within an SMU in Amber or Green zones, i.e., above Red status.

In addition to intrinsic biological reasons for assessing status at the CU scale, this scale is also
relevant to various uses and management activities for Pacifc salmon, e.g., local or terminal
fsheries; food, social and ceremonial fsheries; hatchery enhancement; and watershed restoration
and planning (Fig. 1). While the Fish Stocks provisions pertain to fsheries at scales relevant
to marine harvest management, for many SMUs those fsheries have been restricted in recent
decades (Grant et al. 2020b), such that habitat and hatchery management are playing an increasingly
dominant role in management responses. Food, social and ceremonial use of salmon by First
Nations occur at a variety of scales, often within CUs at the level of populations or specifc spawning
locations. In addition, threats and management responses extend to larger regional or aggregate-
SMU scales, and across species, e.g., impacts related to climate change. Therefore, stock
assessment and management are required at a hierarchy of spatial scales from within CUs to
regional scales, across species.

Given the existing framework for assessing status of Pacifc salmon by CU (Holt et a l. 2009)
and the similar intent between LRPs defned by DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework and
lower benchmarks under the WSP, status against lower benchmarks can be used as a proxy for
status against LRPs but applied at the scale of CUs instead of SMUs. The present work expands
on assessment methods developed under the WSP by integrating statuses across CUs within
an SMU and providing guidance on establishing LRPs at the scale of Pacifc salmon SMUs.
While CUs are nested within SMUs, the number of CUs within each SMU varies among salmon
species. For example, SMUs for Sockeye Salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, tend to contain a larger

3

number of CUs than those for other salmon species because of the relatively high levels of local
adaptation and biodiversity among spawning populations, and the associated small spatial scale
of Sockeye CUs compared with other species.

Figure 1. Schematic representation of hierarchical, nested population structure of Pacifc salmon (left) with
the spatial scales of selected uses and management activities aligned with those scales, including the
scale of Stock Management Unit, SMU (right)

.

The existing framework for CU assessments includes consideration of the fne-scale distribution
of spawners within CUs, e.g., at the stream level (DFO 2016b). Here we also consider the distribution
of populations within CUs in the assessment when it is considered to be important for the sustainability
of the CU or SMU. Identifying relevant spatial scales within CUs when assessing status can be
challenging due to uncertainty and temporal variability in meta-population dynamics and the
impacts of those dynamics on long-term viability, which represents a key source of uncertainty
when defning LRPs.

Alternative spatial scales of assessment and management are used by agencies outside of DFO
for Pacifc salmon, including Designatable Units used by COSEWIC which largely align with
DFO’s CUs, and Stock Groups under the Pacifc Salmon Treaty, which align to some extent with
SMUs. These units are not considered further here. Although the LRPs presented are intended
to be applied at the SMU scale, these methods could also be applied at smaller or larger scales
to inform a variety of management decisions.

We highlight previous recommendations to develop Integrated Management Processes where
management objectives (including those related to biodiversity and sustainability) and management
actions are integrated across biological and socioeconomic relevant scales, sectors, and decision-
making bodies (Withler et al. 2018). Importantly, Withler et al. (2018) recommend management
systems that adaptively respond to statuses from routine assessments at relevant spatial scales.

1.2.1.  Goals

The goals of this Research Document as outlined in the Terms of Reference, were to:

•  Develop candidate methods for identifying SMU-level LRPs for Pacifc salmon that are

consistent with the WSP objective of conserving biodiversity by maintaining CUs above
lower biological benchmarks. These candidate methods include LRPs based on the status
of component CUs and aggregate abundance over multiple CUs, where CU assessments
can be developed using a multidimensional or single-metric approaches, as appropriate.
(Section 4)

•  Document candidate methods for developing LRPs at the SMU-level, including data requirements
and assumptions. (Section 4 and Appendix B). More details are provided in Holt et al. (2023).

•  Document key uncertainties that affect LRP estimates for each method considered, including

uncertainties arising from missing or limited CU-level data. (Section 6)

•  Provide guidance and recommendations on the application of candidate methods over a

range of data types and availability. (Section 5)

1.2.2.  What’s in this Research Document?

This Research Document addresses these four goals, while the companion Research Document

for developing LRPs and more fully demonstrates their implementation on three case studies.
Summaries of methods are included here for the completeness of these guidelines.

In particular, this paper has six sections:

6.  Discussion of uncertainties and recommendations on future research

This work was supported by a technical working group composed of DFO and First Nations
analysts with analytical expertise in stock assessment and the biological basis of serious harm.
The technical working group was not intended to be a venue for consultation or to capture stakeholder
perspectives and socioeconomic objectives. While these considerations are relevant when
developing management responses to stock assessments, they were not considered necessary
for the development of analytical methods for LRPs.

1.2.3.  Scope

While candidate LRPs were evaluated to an extent through sensitivity analyses and retrospective
analyses, a more rigorous closed-loop simulation evaluation of candidate LRPs was beyond the
scope of both Research Documents, and is recommended as a next step. Also, our applications
of LRP methods to case studies are for illustrative purposes only, and are not meant to be a
formal estimation of LRPs for those SMUs. Additional LRP methods could be developed in the
future, aligned with the key principles outlined here (Section 3).

Time-varying population processes, such as changes in productivity, have important impacts on
biological benchmarks, LRPs, and assessment against LRPs. While we describe some recent
approaches for considering those impacts in Section 6, a comprehensive review and evaluation
of the impacts of time-varying parameters on LRPs is beyond the scope of this study. This theme
is an important area for future research.

When developing LRPs, we follow the recommendations of Withler et al. (2018) to remove
hatchery-infuenced populations from biological assessments under the WSP when hatchery
production predominates over natural production, as described in Section 4. Following recent
WSP assessments, we also removed the demographic infuence of hatchery production from
time-series of abundances when data on the proportion of hatchery- vs. natural-origin fsh on the
spawning grounds were available in our case studies. An evaluation of methods for estimating
proportion of hatchery-origin spawners or accounting for them in biological assessments was
beyond the scope of this study.

Here we follow the recommendation of Holt et al. (2009) to assess status of CUs using multiple
metrics, and have implemented this approach using the Pacific Salmon Status Scanner tool
(or, Salmon Scanner), documented in Pestal et al. (In
developed from the implementation of formal, peer-reviewed WSP assessments for Pacific salmon
CUs in Canada (Section 4). A peer-review of the Salmon Scanner is planned for 2022 and is
beyond the scope of this paper.

Decisions about prioritizing CUs for management intervention within an SMU was also beyond
our scope, and requires broader discussion with managers, First Nations, and stakeholders.
This includes evaluating the costs and benefts of conserving individual CUs given differential
vulnerability to climate change or other threats.

While one role of LRPs is to trigger the development of rebuilding plans under the Fish Stocks
provisions, the content and implementation of rebuilding plans is beyond the scope of this paper.
A full review of how LRPs can be integrated into salmon management processes outside of the
Fish Stocks provisions (e.g., including management of habitat and hatcheries) is also beyond our
scope, and is a gap that warrants further discussion. We highlight a few possible roles for LRPs
in Section 2.2. Lastly, we do not review the current defnition of ‘major fsh stock’ as a SMU for
Pacifc salmon under the Fish Stocks provisions.

2.  REVIEW OF REFERENCE POINTS AND THEIR ROLES FOR PACIFIC SALMON

2.1.  INDICATORS AND REFERENCE POINTS FOR PACIFIC SALMON

KEY POINTS:

•
•

LRPs have been widely adopted in Canadian fsheries.
LRPs can be identifed along a variety of indicators, and those indicators can be
categorized as natural metrics, proxies for natural metrics, or composites of metrics.

•  Under Canada’s WSP, a composite of metrics (’multidimensional approach’) is used in
status assessments, including metrics on current spawner abundances, short and
long-term trends in abundances, and the distribution of spawning, among others.

•  DFO has recently developed the Pacifc Salmon Status Scanner tool to rapidly

•

approximate the multidimensional approach for salmon assessments.
In some cases, single-metric approaches in which spawner abundances are compared
with an abundance-based benchmark have been used as proxies for status under the
WSP.

LRPs are common in the assessment and management of marine fsheries where they are used
to identify and communicate status, as components of objectives, and to trigger changes in
harvest rates among other roles (Kronlund et al. 2021; Marentette et al. 2021) (Section 2.2).
LRPs have been widely adopted in Canadian fsheries. A review based on a survey of 177
Canadian stocks excluding salmonids and transboundary stocks, found that 58% had adopted
LRPs, although the methods used to estimate LRPs varied considerably among stocks (Marentette
et al. 2021).

LRPs and indicators of status can be categorized in ways that demonstrate the diversity of
approaches that are available across data types and species life-histories. In particular, LRPs
can be derived from theoretical relationships (e.g., stock-recruitment based reference points),
historical patterns (e.g., abundance from which recovery has been observed in the past), or
empirical analyses on abundances or life-history traits (Marentette et al. In
). For marine
fish species, LRPs are typically estimated as a minimum level of spawning biomass (or proxy)
that should not be breached (Shelton and Rice 2002; Kronlund et al. 2018; Marentette et al.
2021). DFO (2009a) identifies additional indicators such as catch rate indices, size and age
profiles, and sex ratios that “can and should be considered for use in defining serious harm and
guiding decision-making in relation to stock condition” (DFO 2009a). In general, indicators

prep.

7

of status can be categorized as natural metrics (e.g., total abundances or other biological or
population characteristics), a proxy for a natural metric (e.g., abundances of indicator stocks), or
a composite of indicators that combine information over multiple dimensions or biological metrics
of status (Marentette et al. In

).

prep.

The composite or multidimensional approach for assessing status, sometimes called a “traffc
light” approach (Shelton and Rice 2002), is particularly useful when theoretical or historical
abundance-based metrics are not estimable or applicable, or when data are limited (Dowling et
al. 2015). Multidimensional approaches allow for consideration of numerous data sources often
including expert knowledge to integrate conficting metrics within a ssessments. For example,
multidimensional reference points have been applied to Snow Crab, Chionoecetes opilio, in
Canada, where data on catch per unit effort, egg clutches, and discards are integrated in stock
assessments (Mullowney et al. 2018). Multidimensional approaches can also be useful to address
mismatches in scales among biological stocks, the unit of management, and the spatial scale of
data collection, when metrics capture processes at a variety of scales. These scale mismatches
are not uncommon among marine species, especially invertebrate and salmonid species (DFO
2016a; Mullowney et al. 2020). They can create challenges when identifying LRPs at the scale of
major stocks (DFO 2021a), and can make undesirable states in fsh populations diffcult to detect
and mitigate.

Methods for estimating reference points for Pacifc salmon are diverse, often taking advantage
of its semelparous and anadromous life-history and limits on capacity in freshwater, and other
population characteristics (Chaput et al. 2012; Portley and Geiger 2014). Under Canada’s WSP,
status assessments integrate data across numerous indicators or metrics representing different
population characteristics, including current spawner abundances, short and long-term trends
in abundances, distribution of spawning, and fshing mortality relative to population productivity
(Holt et al. 2009). Benchmarks are established for each metric and an overall multidimensional
estimate of CU status is obtained by integrating status among metrics (Grant and Pestal 2013;
DFO 2015; DFO 2016b; Grant et al. 2020a). An advantage of this approach is that CUs missing
data for any single metric can still be evaluated against remaining metrics, making the framework
applicable across a relatively broad range of data types and hence CUs. Expert-driven processes
to integrate often conficting metrics within the multidimensional framework have been implemented
for numerous Pacifc salmon CUs in Canada, such as Fraser River Sockeye Salmon (Grant et
al. 2012, 2020a; Grant and Pestal 2013), Interior Fraser River Coho Salmon, Oncorhynchus
kisutch (DFO 2015), and Southern BC Chinook Salmon (DFO 2016b). However, these expert-
driven processes can be challenging to implement on a broad and timely basis due to the high
demand they place on time and staff resources. Based on the consistencies that emerged from
assessments where the integration of multiple metrics has been applied, Pestal et al. (In
prep.
developed an algorithm to approximate overall WSP status by combining those metrics in a
decision tree, at the scale of CUs. This algorithm was incorporated into DFO’s Pacifc Salmon
Status Scanner and then verified by local assessment experts and tested with ‘out-of-sample’
CUs not included in the original formulation (Pestal et al. In

).

)

prep.

In some cases, single-metric approaches in which spawner abundances are compared with an
abundance-based benchmark have been used as proxies for WSP status both by organizations
external to DFO (Commission 2016; Pacifc Salmon Foundation 2020) and occasionally within
DFO (e.g., Barkley Sockeye Salmon, Chaput et al. 2012). One recommended lower benchmark
on spawning abundances under Canada’s WSP is Sgen, the abundance resulting in recovery
to SMSY  in one salmon generation under equilibrium conditions (Holt 2009). Benchmarks on
spawner abundances for data-limited contexts have also been identifed in recognition that the

8

data required to estimate spawner-recruitment based benchmarks are often not available (e.g.,
Parken et al. 2006, Section 4.2). Biological benchmarks under the WSP are distinguished from
triggers in harvest control rules that incorporate additional socioeconomic considerations beyond
biological considerations (Holt and Irvine 2013).

2.2.  ROLES OF LRPS IN CANADA

KEY POINTS:

The roles of LRPs for marine fish stocks in Canada can include:
  triggering rebuilding plans under the Fish Stocks provisions,
  communicating conservation risks to decision makers and the public,
  informing management decisions about fisheries as part of measurable objectives or
operational control points, and
  as a component of performance metrics within a Management Procedure
Framework.

o

Identifying LRPs is the responsibility of DFO’s Science Sector.
For Pacific salmon the application of LRPs has been limited, as fisheries management
is often based on a wide range of management decisions made at different spatial
scales (e.g., stream-level escapement goals, time-area closures, exploitation limits on
aggregates).

For marine fsh stocks in Canada, LRPs have several roles including triggering rebuilding plans
under DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework (DFO 2009a) and the Fisheries Act, communicating
conservation risks to decision makers and the public, and informing management decisions
about fsheries. For example, LRPs can be used as part of measurable objectives and can
also be applied as operational control points which are points where management actions are
triggered within harvest control rules. A conservation goal might be to avoid low biomass levels
where serious harm is expected to occur which can be translated to a measurable objective to
avoid spawner abundances lower than an LRP with a high probability (e.g., 95%) over a specifed
time period. This objective can then inform the placement of operational control points within the
harvest control rule. However, there can be several operational control points in the harvest
control rule and these can be positioned to achieve a suite of biological and socioeconomic
objectives beyond those associated with serious harm, usually by a diverse range of managers,
First Nations, and stakeholders. In contrast, DFO’s Science Sector is responsible for identifying
LRPs based only on biological considerations (DFO 2021a).

In addition, LRPs can be used in performance metrics within a Management Procedure Framework
(or Management Strategy Evaluation) to identify candidate procedures that achieve conservation
objectives (e.g., 95% probability of staying above a LRP over a specifed period) among other
objectives (DFO 2021c). This approach explicitly accounts for a range of uncertainties in the
biology of the stock, dynamics of the feet, observations of abundances and ages at return, and
the implementation of management decisions. Simulation evaluation of management procedures
is widely viewed as a best practice for informing management decisions under uncertainty (Punt
et al. 2020). For fsheries in which management procedures have been simulation tested, assessment
of stock status relative to an LRP is not necessary so long as the management procedure selected
has been demonstrated to meet conservation (and possibly other) objectives over a range of
uncertainties (i.e., modelled scenarios) about stock and fshery dynamics. One advantage of
this approach is that a single best underlying model (or LRP) describing the population and feet

9

dynamics need not be identifed. Instead, management procedures can be evaluated against a
suite of plausible underlying models or assumptions.

For Pacifc salmon, the application of LRPs at the SMU-level has been more limited. Fisheries
management for Pacifc salmon is often based on a wide range of management decisions made
at different spatial scales (e.g., stream-level escapement goals, time-area closures, exploitation
limits on aggregates), instead of LRPs per se. Also, the application of Management Procedure
Frameworks is not common for Pacifc salmon where the impact of diverse management levers
and their interactions are often diffcult to quantify (e.g., hatcheries and harvest, though see the
AHA model documented by HSRG (Hatchery Scientifc Review Group) 2009). The roles of LRPs
will likely evolve for Pacifc salmon over time, and an exhaustive review is beyond the scope of
this paper.

3. PRINCIPLES FOR LRP DEVELOPMENT

3.1. PRINCIPLES

KEY POINTS:

Principles for identifying Pacifc salmon LRPs are adapted from national guidance on
LRPs.
Principle 1. LRPs should be selected based on the best available information.
Principle 2. LRPs should be consistent with the goal of avoiding serious harm.
Principle 3. LRPs should be operational, i.e., feasible to calculate and relevant to
policy and management.
Principle 4. LRPs should be reliably estimable and plausible.
Principle 5. When selecting among multiple methods for determining LRPs, the choice
should take into account uncertainty.
Principle 6. Pacifc salmon LRPs should be consistent with the goals and objectives of
the WSP.
These principles are intended to guide our approach for developing Pacifc salmon
LRPs while providing fexibility due to differences in local biological characteristics,
data qualities and data quantities, among salmon species and stocks.

Here we outline principles for developing LRPs for Pacific salmon, adapted from those developed
for national-level guidance on LRPs (Marentette et al. In
flexibility in the development of LRPs to respect differences in species life-histories and data
types, quantities, and qualities, and is not meant to be prescriptive. By following similar principles,
Pacifc salmon LRPs are aligned with national direction.

). That guidance allows for

Principle 1. LRPs should be selected based on the best available information for the SMU,
including evidence of serious harm, data and knowledge informing underlying biological processes,
). Criteria for
Indigenous Knowledge, and comparison with similar SMUs (Marentette et al. In
evaluating best scientific information developed for US National Standards may be applicable
here (“US Code of Federal Regulations” 2021). These criteria are: relevance, inclusiveness,
objectivity, transparency and openness, timeliness, verifcation and validation, and peer review.
In addition, scientifc information should include an evaluation of uncertainties and identify gaps
in our understanding or information. When uncertainty exists in identifying the most appropriate
approach to defne an LRP, these uncertainties should be acknowledged and considered when

providing LRP recommendations. Where the weight-of-evidence supports a set of assumptions
or hypotheses associated with a candidate LRP, then this LRP can be recommended. Where
evidence is inconclusive, this uncertainty should be integrated into the estimation of status and
the uncertainties should be clearly communicated.

Within this principle, it is recognized that science is not static and new fndings continually advance
our understanding of best available information. In particular, peer-review is necessary to ensure
that the quality and credibility of data and methods for LRP development meet the standards of
the scientifc c ommunity. When determining whether to conduct a peer review, the level of novelty
and complexity, and any previous peer-reviewed stock assessments, should be considered.
Although routine updates may not need formal peer review, new LRPs or the application of
benchmarks and LRPs to new CUs and SMUs may require peer review.

Similarly, best practices, or practices that have been demonstrated to work well, can be used to
inform reference points, as defned by Sainsbury ( 2008): “The ‘best practice’ concept is based on
the best practice that has been demonstrated through use, and recognizes that views of what is
‘best’ will continuously improve with experience. Best practice is not an absolute or fxed entity,
or a guarantee of adequacy. It is based on experience to date and it is expected to evolve over
time.”

Principle 2. LRPs should be consistent with the goal of avoiding serious harm to the SMU,
as described in DFO (2009a) and Section 1 of this paper. The LRP should be set above the
level where serious harm occurs and should avoid long-term losses that may accompany such
undesirable states, such as those related to fshing and ecosystem components, e.g., dependent
predators (DFO 2009a, 2009b). In addition, LRPs should be representative of the entire SMU. In
cases where only components of an SMU are monitored (e.g., CUs), the monitored component
can be used to assess SMU status when it is thought to represent the entire SMU (Section 5).

Principle 3. LRPs should be operational. They should be feasible to calculate based on data
that are available and relevant to the policy context and management of fsheries on S MUs. Data
availability varies widely among CUs and SMUs, requiring a variety of approaches for CU and
SMU-level assessments. No one method will be operational across all cases. Also, it is benefcial
if LRPs are easy to communicate to managers, First Nations, and stakeholders in a way that
informs decisions at time-scales relevant to management. Other operational considerations are
cost-effectiveness and simplicity in understanding.

Principle 4. LRPs should be reliably estimated. To the extent possible, LRPs should indicate
a level above where serious harm occurs with acceptable accuracy and precision, instead of
capturing random noise or observation errors. Reliable estimation will depend on the quality
and frequency of data collection, model specifcation, and the evidence to support underlying
relationships and population dynamics used to derive LRPs. Reliability can be addressed by
checking the sensitivity of LRPs to uncertainties in underlying data, models, or assumptions via
sensitivity analyses or simulation-evaluation, or simply by assessing plausibility given biological
or life-history information about the SMU (Marentette et al. In

).

prep.

LRPs can be derived using multiple analytical approaches. If LRPs cannot be estimated reliably
using one method or approach, then it is advisable to consider alternative approaches based
on different sets of assumptions and/or data. When LRP estimates converge using different
approaches, this increases support that the methods capture underlying population dynamics
despite differing assumptions and use of available data.

11

Where possible, a statistically integrated approach for estimating LRPs should be considered
in order to propagate uncertainties throughout analyses and to be consistent with current best
practices in fsheries stock assessments (Punt et a l. 2 020). Staton et a l. (2017) and DeFilippo
et al. (2021) provide recent examples of integrated models used for salmon assessments. Both
studies show that uncertainty propagation increases realism of model estimates and associated
uncertainty. However, Staton et al. (2017) demonstrated that similar point estimates of current
status can be achieved by using sequential estimation approaches and the benefts of statistically
integrated approaches may not be large enough to warrant an integrated analysis in all cases.

Principle 5. When selecting among multiple methods for defning LRPs, the choice should take
into account uncertainty. Candidate methods for LRPs vary in how and the extent to which they
account for uncertainty in underlying data, modelled population dynamics (parameter assumptions
and model structure), and derivation of CU-level statuses. These uncertainties create risks of
LRPs providing a misleading threshold of serious harm. All else being equal, methods that rely
on high quality data, include fewer assumptions, and explicitly account for underlying uncertainties
should be preferred.

When considering LRPs under alternative model assumptions, LRPs can be chosen based on
strength of evidence for underlying assumptions or averaged when alternative assumptions are
equally plausible. Further, the sensitivity of LRPs to various underlying model assumptions or
data qualities and quantities can be evaluated in simulation, where LRPs that are less sensitive
to key uncertainties would be preferred.

Principle 6. In addition to principles derived for marine species in general (Principles 1-5) and to
meet the goal of avoiding serious harm under DFO’s Precautionary Approach Policy (Principle 2),
Pacifc salmon LRPs should be consistent with the goals and objectives of the WSP. The WSP
requires both the defnition of biological units and an assessment of their status along biological
metrics, with lower benchmarks used to represent the level that avoids risk of extinction. This
approach is consistent with avoiding serious harm to the CU. Above the lower benchmarks
(above Red status), irreversible or slowly reversible impacts are avoided. Ignoring CU-level
status by focusing solely on SMU-level status can result in serial depletion (or loss) of weak
component CUs within an SMU, resulting in a possibly misleading indication status and serious
harm. Therefore, to be consistent with the WSP, LRPs should consider status of component
CUs.

3.2.  APPLYING THE PRINCIPLES TO LRP DEVELOPMENT

Our goal is to provide overall guidelines on LRP development following the principles listed above
while providing fexibility due to differences in biological characteristics and types, qualities
and quantities of data among Pacifc salmon species and S MUs. We indicate the extent to
which candidate LRP methods proposed here are aligned with these principles. Additional LRP
methods may be developed in the future to capture a broader range of data availability, quality,
and types, and/or dimensions of biological status; the development of these additional methods
should be aligned with the key principles summarized here.

In the next section, methods for estimating CU status are described, as implemented in previous
status assessments under the WSP, and candidate LRPs are proposed. Guidelines on how to
choose among LRPs is described in Section 5.

4.  PROPOSED LRP METHODS FOR PACIFIC SALMON

LRP methods require assessments of status at the scale of CUs. Abundance data required for
CU assessments are sometimes infuenced by hatchery enhancement, which requires additional
considerations. This section includes recommended methods to derive CU-level statuses and
estimates LRPs. Within CU status assessments, we frst describe our approach for accounting
for hatchery enhancement.

4.1.  CONTRIBUTION OF HATCHERIES

KEY POINTS:

•  While hatcheries are a useful tool for augmenting production for harvest and

conservation, they can reduce wild genetic diversity and ftness and are considered a
risk factor for the long-term persistence of CUs.

•  Salmon that are enhanced by hatcheries are not considered ’wild’ under the Wild

•

Salmon Policy and are not usually included in assessments of biological status.
The data used to assess the contribution of hatcheries to spawning are associated with
high uncertainties related to the tagging method used, sampling rates, uncertainty in
survival of natural vs. hatchery-origin fsh, and observation errors.

•

•  Populations dominated by wild fsh but infuenced by hatchery strays from outside of
the basin are generally included in CU assessments, but these strays may bias
estimates of natural production and resulting assessments.
Following previous WSP status assessments, when data are available, the
demographic infuence of hatchery production can be removed from time-series of
abundances. This step applies to populations included in analyses, after removing
populations with high hatchery infuence. Where data to differentiate hatchery- from
natural-origin spawners are not available, total spawner abundances include
hatchery-origin fsh, representing a key source of uncertainty for hatchery-infuenced
populations.

•  Methods to process data on hatchery contributions within assessments and guidance

on best practices within DFO continue to evolve.

Hatcheries contribute to spawning abundances of many salmon populations and can be used as
a conservation tool as well as a way to increase the availability of fsh for harvest. Hatcheries can
also reduce wild genetic diversity and ftness, defned as adult-to-adult reproductive success, and
are considered a risk factor for the long-term persistence of CUs (Withler et al. 2018). Salmon
that are hatchery-origin, as well as their progeny, are not considered ‘wild’ under the Wild Salmon
Policy. Typically, only populations dominated by wild salmon are included in assessments of
biological status. However, separating out the infuence of hatcheries in time-series of spawner
abundances and recruitment is challenging, in part because hatchery-origin salmon are often not
marked, e.g., with fn clips or fsh tags, and so are indistinguishable from natural-origin spawners.
Also, many salmon escapement programs, such as those where salmon spawners are counted
from helicopters (Parken et al. 2003) do not have biological sampling programs to collect, mark
and tag data from individual salmon.

13

4.1.1.  Accounting for genetic risks of hatchery production

Following Withler et al. (2018), we recommend including only populations without signifcant
hatchery enhancement in analyses of CU and SMU biological status consistent with the WSP.
Proportionate Natural Infuence, PNI, is a metric of the genetic risk of hatcheries on natural
populations, with values < 0.5 indicating integrated-hatchery populations, where more than
half of spawners are hatchery origin, values ⩾ 0.5 and < 0.72 indicating integrated-transition
populations where natural-origin fsh predominate, and values ⩾ 0.72 indicating integrated-wild
populations, where more than half of spawners are considered ‘wild’ under the WSP (Withler et
al. 2018). While these guidelines were proposed for Chinook Salmon where hatchery enhancement
is most common, they are also applicable to other salmon species (Withler et al. 2018).

assessments based on their biological designation and Proportionate Natural Infuence, PNI, taken from
Withler et al. (2018).

When assessing population status, Withler et al. (2018) recommend the inclusion of integrated-
wild populations within biological assessments under the WSP, and provisionally, integrated-
transition populations (i.e., PNI ⩾ 0.5 ). Accordingly, only populations with PNI values ⩾ 0.5
were included in the assessment of CU and SMU status in our case study applications. Stricter
defnitions of hatchery enhancement can be considered by including only populations with PNI
values ⩾ 0.72. In practice, applying this stricter threshold for our case study on Chinook Salmon
resulted in excluding most data since reliable time-series of PNI values and spawner abundances
are only available for exploitation-rate indicator populations, which tend to be populations with
hatcheries. Adopting a threshold of ⩾ 0.5, a level associated with more than half of spawners
being natural origin, was the result of a trade-off between assessing remaining CU-level biodiversity
and excluding signifcant hatchery impacts. For some populations, early periods of high enhancement
can be removed from time-series and assessments can focus on recent periods without signifcant
enhancement (Grant et al. 2012). For hatcheries aimed at rebuilding critically depleted populations,
production may be dominated by hatchery-origin fsh for a period until abundances are above
lower conservation thresholds. Guidelines on the assessment and management of these conservation
hatcheries are currently being developed by DFO’s Salmonid Enhancement Program, including
regular assessments of the proportion of hatchery-origin spawning.

14

Data used to assess hatchery contribution to spawning and estimate PNI values are associated
with high uncertainties. For our case study on Chinook Salmon, proportions of hatchery-origin
spawners were determined from spawning ground surveys for thermal marking on hatchery-
origin salmon. When data on thermal marking were not available, coded-wire tags (CWTs)
were used to identify hatchery-origin spawners, but were associated with increased uncertainty.
Large interannual variability in the proportion of hatchery-origin spawners can result from natural
variability in survival of hatchery- versus natural-origin spawners, low sampling rates for hatchery-
origin spawners, and high observation errors, requiring decisions about temporal averaging.
For the westcoast Vancouver Island Chinook case study, we averaged over the available time
series where hatchery objectives have remained constant, though recommend further research
quantifying the sources of uncertainties and evaluating the sensitivity of results to various time
periods for averaging (e.g., recent generation versus entire time period).

In addition to guidance on biological assessments under the WSP, Withler et al. (2018) further
recommend developing biological goals for hatchery-infuenced populations and documenting
trade-offs between increased genetic risk to wild populations from hatchery production and
increased abundance required to support other objectives. Enhancement plans are being developed
for hatchery-infuenced populations by DFO’s Salmonid Enhancement Program, which include
objectives related to PNI, harvest, assessment, and stewardship and measures to achieve
objectives. Once developed, enhancement plans can be integrated with harvest and habitat
planning within integrated management and/or rebuilding plans. Guidelines and methods for
estimating PNI values are also being documented by DFO’s Salmonid Enhancement Program
(DFO, In

)3.

prep.

4.1.2.  Wild populations infuenced by straying from hatcheries

In addition, Withler et al. (2018) recommend that populations dominated by wild fsh but infuenced
by hatchery stays (called ‘wild stray-infuenced’ populations) should be included in CU assessments
under the WSP. These populations receive strays from out-of-basin hatchery programs, but do
not contain hatcheries themselves. Although the majority of fsh may be wild in these populations,
one-way gene fow modelling suggests that over time PNI values will decline to levels consistent
with hatchery-dominated systems with continued straying. In practice, straying from out-of-basin
hatcheries and the genetic impacts are generally not monitored or assessed, and so out-of-basin
strays are included in total abundances within biological assessments. However, this represents
a gap in our knowledge of hatchery impacts and our ability to implement recommendations
from Withler et al. (2018). Two exceptions are Candy and Beacham (2000) which describes
patterns of straying of Chinook salmon in the Fraser watershed and Vancouver Island, and more
thoroughly on the west coast of Vancouver Island where studies estimating the extent of straying
for Chinook Salmon are on-going and may inform the evaluation of hatchery impacts in future
biological assessments (W. Luedke pers. comm.).

4.1.3.  Removing the demographic infuence of hatchery production

For some WSP assessments that include integrated-transition and integrated-wild populations,
the demographic infuence of hatchery production is removed from time-series of abundances
when data on the proportion of hatchery- versus natural-origin fsh on the spawning grounds

are available (e.g., from marking of hatchery-origin fsh or other data on the relative survival
of hatchery-origin fsh, DFO 2015). Specifcally, the contribution of hatchery-origin production
is removed from both the benchmark estimation and metric of spawner abundance. For stock-
recruitment based benchmarks, the contribution of hatchery-origin fsh is removed from recruitment
estimates but not escapement, as it is assumed that all natural spawners reproduce successfully
in the wild and contribute to natural production. This way, the spawner-recruitment relationship
represents the production derived from spawners in the natural environment. For the metric of
spawner abundances, the contribution of hatchery-origin fsh can be removed from spawner time
series to reduce the infuence of variability in annual hatchery production on status (DFO 2015).
Although removing hatchery-origin fsh from analyses is inconsistent with the recommendation
of Withler et al. (2018) to include all spawners in biological assessments when natural spawning
predominates (PNI ⩾ 0.5), it is consistent with existing published WSP assessments on which
our analyses relied and developing new time-series was beyond the scope of this study.

In most cases where hatchery-origin fsh are not marked or sampled on the spawning grounds,
data on the proportion of hatchery-origin spawners are not available. In these cases, WSP
assessments generally rely on total spawner abundances including hatchery contribution, as
long as spawner abundances are believed to be predominantly natural origin (e.g., PNI ⩾ 0.5)
(e.g., Southern BC Chinook Salmon, DFO 2016b), aligned with recommendations of Withler
et al. (2018). In these cases, there may a risk of current status being confounded by hatchery
production which may mask changes in natural production and obscure inferences for unenhanced
populations in the CU. This risk is partly mediated but not eliminated by removing populations
that are dominated by hatchery-origin fsh from assessments. In general, we recommend fexibility
in addressing hatchery-infuenced populations in assessments as methods to process hatchery-
origin fsh and associated guidance evolve.

4.2.  ESTIMATION OF CU STATUS

KEY POINTS:

•  We recommend that CU-level status consider multiple metrics, either integrated

through formal status assessments or through the Pacifc Salmon Status Scanner
tool, also called the Salmon Scanner.
The Salmon Scanner provides status from a composite of metrics and benchmarks on
spawner abundances, and long- and short-term trends in spawner abundances.

•

•  Various benchmarks on spawner abundances have been identifed to account for

differences in data types, quantities and qualities among CUs, including those based
on stock-recruitment relationships, percentiles of historical spawner abundances and
freshwater spawning and rearing capacity.

•  Distributional metrics of spawning have been included in formal WSP assessments.
•
For the purposes of LRP development, CU statuses were derived in two ways: using
multiple metrics applied within the Salmon Scanner and a single metric on spawner
abundances to demonstrate the consistency in these approaches and highlight any
differences.

To be consistent with the multidimensional approach to WSP status assessments described in
Holt et al. (2009), we recommend that CU-level status consider multiple metrics, either integrated
through formal status assessments (Grant and Pestal 2013; DFO 2015; DFO 2016b; Grant et
al. 2020a) or through other multidimensional approaches like the Pacifc Salmon Status Scanner

16

prep.

). In our case study applications Holt et al. (2023), we demonstrate the
(Pestal et al. In
application of the Pacifc Salmon Status Scanner tool as a way to rapidly approximate more
detailed WSP status assessments. The Salmon Scanner (i) estimates statuses for individual
WSP metrics and (ii) applies a decision tree algorithm to integrate multiple status estimates into
a single status estimate (e.g., Red, Amber, Green) based on data type and availability. By using
multiple metrics (Table 2), the Salmon Scanner allows for the assessment of status across a wide
range of data availabilities. When data for a single metric are not available, other metrics can
be used to inform status. The decision tree algorithm was verified with data and local expertise
(Pestal et al. In
incorporated into the application of this tool (S. Grant, pers. comm.). The Salmon Scanner can
provide assessments under data limitations, and methods to account for resulting uncertainties
from these data limitations are currently being integrated into the Scanner.

). An expert review of rapid status results for each CU is intended to be

al. 2009) (6) (Grant and Pestal 2013); (7) (Porszt et al. 2012)

Various benchmarks on spawner abundances have been identifed to account for differences in
data types, quantities and qualities among CUs. For data-rich CUs where spawner-recruitment
relationships can be reliably estimated, Holt (2009) recommend a lower benchmark at the abundance
resulting in recovery to spawner abundances at maximum sustained yield, SMSY, in one salmon
generation under equilibrium conditions, Sgen. When applying stock-recruitment analyses, the
spatial scale of density dependence should be carefully considered, which may be smaller or
larger than the CU. Where recruitment time-series are not available and productivity is assumed
to be moderate or high, and harvest rates moderate or low, specifed percentiles of observed
spawner time-series (e.g., 25th) can be used as a proxy for spawner-recruitment benchmarks
(Holt et al. 2018). For Chinook, Sockeye, and Coho Salmon where production is often limited by
the quantity of freshwater habitat, equilibrium spawner abundances can be predicted from habitat
characteristics to inform abundance-based benchmarks (Parken et al. 2006; Noble et al. 2015).
For example, Parken et al. (2006) use the relationship between watershed area and spawner-

17

recruitment based reference points in a meta-analysis of Chinook Salmon populations from
across the Pacifc region to predict reference points for Chinook populations without recruitment
data. Also, information on freshwater habitat capacity can be used to develop informative priors
for stock-recruitment benchmarks estimated with Bayesian techniques (e.g., Atlas et al. (2020)
for Sockeye Salmon).

Similarly, metrics and benchmarks on long-term and short-term trends in spawner abundances
are included in the Salmon Scanner. Long-term trends are measured by the ratio of recent
generational geometric average spawner abundances relative to the long-term geometric average,
and short-term trends are measured as the percent change in spawner abundances over 3
generations, the time period used in COSEWIC assessments (Holt 2009). Lower benchmarks on
these metrics represent levels below which there is increased risk of extinction (Holt et al. 2009).

In addition, metrics on the distribution of spawning within a CU can be considered in WSP assessments
(Peacock and Holt 2010; Peacock and Holt 2012; DFO 2016b), but may not be required for all
salmon species and to-date have not been included in the Salmon Scanner. In one example, the
distribution of spawners across spawning sites and contractions in that distribution over time
were considered in a WSP assessment for southern BC Chinook (DFO 2016b). In addition,
recovery targets for Interior Fraser Coho account for the distribution of spawners among sub-
populations (Interior Fraser Coho Recovery Team 2006). One challenge to applying metrics
on distribution is identifying benchmarks that distinguish populations with increased risk of
extinction.

For the purposes of LRP development, CU statuses for case study applications were derived in
two ways, using the multiple metrics applied within the Salmon Scanner and a single metric on
spawner abundances. We applied both to demonstrate the consistency in these approaches
and highlight any differences. When only a single metric is applied to derive status, there is
a risk of providing a misleading assessment if other metrics that would have been used in a
multidimensional approach provide contrary information, but are not included. A full review of the
Salmon Scanner will be provided in Pestal et al. (In

4.3.  LRP ESTIMATION

KEY POINTS:

•  CU status-based LRPs are calculated from the proportion of CUs within an SMU that
are assessed as being above Red status, with 100% as the recommended LRP.

•  CU status-based LRPs are recommended as the default approach for estimating LRPs

•

•

for Pacific salmon and triggering rebuilding plans under the Fisheries Act.
LRPs along a gradient of aggregate SMU-level abundances (’aggregate abundance
LRPs’) may be required for fisheries management decisions at the SMU scale, and are
considered supplemental to CU status-based LRPs.
Two types of aggregate abundance LRPs are identified: logistic regression LRPs and
projection LRPs.

o

o

  Both rely on the relationship between observed aggregate abundances and statuses
of component CUs, but logistic regression LRPs rely on empirical data directly
whereas projection LRPs are derived from projections of CU-level population
dynamics, usually parameterized from empirical data.
  Both aggregate abundance LRPs are probabilistic in nature, identifying the
aggregate abundances associated with an acceptable probability of all CUs
achieving status above Red.

•  An assumption of the logistic regression LRPs is that the relationship between

aggregate abundance and CU-level status observed historically represents the current
(and future) relationship. If the covariance in population dynamics among CUs is
non-stationary, logistic regression LRPs may not represent levels above serious harm.

•  Projection LRPs can integrate plausible ranges of parameter uncertainties that may

differ from those observed historically, unlike logistic regression LRPs.

In this section, LRPs that integrate statuses of component CUs are proposed. These LRPs fall
into two categories: those based on the proportion of component CUs above the Red zone,
called CU status-based LRPs, and those based on aggregate abundances, called aggregate
abundance LRPs. Aggregate abundance LRPs are further subdivided into logistic regression
LRPs and projection LRPs (Fig. 2). A more detailed description of LRPs is included in Holt et al.
(2023).

4.3.1.  CU status-based LRPs

CU status-based LRPs are calculated from the proportion of CUs within an SMU that are assessed
as being above Red status (Fig. 3). To be consistent with the intent of the WSP to preserve
biodiversity at the CU-level, we identify an LRP at 100% of CUs having status above Red (i.e.,
either Amber or Green). See Section 5 for a step-wise approach for identifying LRPs that further
considers data limitations when identifying the proportion of CUs above the Red zone, and
Section 6 for a description of associated uncertainties. CU statuses are derived using the approaches
described in Section 4.2, and are submitted to peer review, as described in Section 5.

Alignment with LRP Principles

CU status-based LRPs can be based on the best available information (Principle 1) by incorporating
multiple dimensions of status through formal, peer-reviewed WSP status assessments or the use
of the Salmon Scanner with peer review. By using status derived from the annual implementation
of the Salmon Scanner, relevant and timely information is used to inform status in a way that is
transparent and open. CU status-based LRPs represent serious harm (Principle 2) as indicated
by the status of any one component CU within the SMU being in the Red zone under the WSP,
given that the deterioration of stock structure (i.e., loss of diversity) can itself be a form of serious
harm. CU status-based LRPs are operational (Principle 3) because they are simple to calculate
and communicate as a proportion of CU statuses. For SMUs where harvest is managed at the
aggregate SMU scale, however, CU status-based LRPs are not easily incorporated into harvest
control rules at that scale. Reliability of estimation (Principle 4) depends in part on the underlying
data and is CU- and SMU-dependent. Uncertainties are not currently propagated from CU-level
benchmarks and statuses from the Salmon Scanner, to LRPs and SMU statuses (Principle 5).
CU status-based LRPs are well aligned with Principle 6, being derived directly from WSP metrics
of status for CUs.

A further advantage of this method is that it can easily be extended to other spatial scales under
which Pacifc salmon are managed. For example, CUs can be assessed individually when threats
and responses are localized to specifc watersheds, e.g., Cultus Sockeye which has unique
threats to its spawning and rearing habitats. CU status can also be aggregated at various scales
and across species when threats and responses are broader, e.g., for the management of numerous
salmon species and CUs impacted by the Big Bar landslide reported in 2019.

In addition to CU status-based LRPs, we developed LRPs along a gradient of aggregate SMU-
level abundance accounting for component CU-level statuses. These ‘aggregate abundance
LRPs’ may be required for fsheries management decisions at the SMU scale, but are considered
supplemental to CU status-based LRPs for the purposes of the Fish Stocks provisions. We
identifed two types of aggregate abundance LRPs: (1) logistic regression LRPs and (2) projection
LRPs (Fig. 2). Both LRPs rely on the relationship between observed aggregate abundances and
statuses of the component CUs, but they differ in that logistic regression LRPs rely on empirical
data directly, whereas projection LRPs are derived from projections of CU-level population
dynamics usually parameterized from empirical data. Also, both LRPs are probabilistic in nature,
identifying the aggregate abundances associated with an acceptable probability of all CUs
achieving status above the Red zone. To an extent uncertainty in the underlying relationship
between observed aggregate abundances and component CU-level statuses is represented in
the probabilistic nature of these LRPs; larger uncertainties result in higher LRP values and vice
versa, all else remaining equal. The ability of aggregate-abundance LRPs to reliably represent

20

thresholds of serious harm at the CU level depend on the strength of the underlying relationship
between aggregate abundance and CU statuses as inferred from observed data.

Logistic regression LRPs

Logistic regression LRPs can be derived from an empirically estimated relationship between
CU-level statuses and aggregate SMU abundance. This method extends the CU status-based
LRP by identifying the aggregate abundance level that has historically been associated with all
component CUs having status above the Red zone, as approximated from status on a single
metric of spawner abundances relative to a lower benchmark. For each year of observed data,
SMU-level status is quantifed as a Bernoulli variable: 1 (success) = all CUs have estimated
status greater than the lower benchmark and 0 (failure) = all CUs did not have status greater
than the lower benchmark, i.e., at least one CU was assessed below the lower benchmark. A
logistic regression is then ft to these outcomes to estimate the probability that all CUs have
abundances above their lower benchmarks as a function of aggregate SMU-level spawner
abundances. Given the difference in number of component CUs among salmon species (more
for Sockeye Salmon than for other species), the likelihood of at least one component CU having
Red status is greater for Sockeye. The following logistic regression equation is used to estimate
LRPs,

where, p is probability, B0  and B1  are estimated logistic regression parameters and Si,t  is spawner

An example logistic regression ft is shown in Figure 4, with LRPs associated with four probability
thresholds, 0.5, 0.66, 0.90, 0.99, representing minimum levels above which probabilities are
more likely than not, likely, very likely, and virtually certain, respectively, as defned by the International
Panel on Climate Change, IPCC (Mastrandrea et al. 2010, Table 3). Mastrandrea et al. (2010)
also highlight the range 33%-66% as representing ‘as likely as not’, encompassing probabilities
slightly above even (50%-66%). The mid-point at 50% represents an equal probability that
all CUs will be above Red status as there is that they will not. An additional consideration in
this step is the probability threshold for triggering LRPs described in DFO’s Guidelines for the
Implementation of Rebuilding Plans (DFO 2021d). These guidelines specify that, “unless otherwise
defned in stock-specifc precautionary approach frameworks, the LRP should be considered
breached if the terminal year stock status indicator is estimated to be at or below the LRP with
a greater than 50% probability or if the projected stock status indicator falls below the LRP with
a greater than 50% probability under a zero catch scenario in a 1 year projection”. While using
a 50% probability threshold of one or more CUs having Red status is not directly analogous,
in both cases the probability threshold chosen represents the probability of the stock avoiding
serious harm.

We recommend positioning LRPs as thresholds with at least a 50% probability of all component
CUs being above Red status, but do not recommend a specifc probability level above that
minimum. Instead, we demonstrate LRPs under various choices of probability levels. Although
LRPs are intended to be identifed by Science to represent the best scientifc estimate of the level
below which serious harm is expected to occur (DFO 2021a) and without necessarily introducing
additional precaution under uncertainty, there is no scientifc basis to choose one probability over
others. We distinguish the biological basis of serious harm (any one CU having Red status) from
the probability of this occurring, which implies a decision about risk tolerance.

Uncertainty in logistic regression LRP estimates can be quantifed based on confdence or
credible intervals on the LRP estimate. See our application to Interior Fraser Coho Salmon for
an example Holt et al. (2023). We recommend evaluating the ft of the logistic regression prior to

the development of LRPs to identify its reliability in determining serious harm to component CUs.
Diagnostics commonly used for logistic regression of Bernoulli distributed data are provided in
Holt et al. (2023). For example, diagnostics can evaluate the assumptions that, (a) aggregate
abundances are linearly related to log-odds of all CUs being above their lower benchmarks, (b)
observations are independent, and (c) there are no infuential outliers. In addition, the statistical
signifcance of the predictor variable (aggregate abundance) and the goodness-of-ft of the
logistic model can inform its reliability for determining LRPs. Furthermore, the classifcation
accuracy of LRPs developed from a logistic regression can be evaluated on the observed data
using a performance metric called the hit ratio. This ratio represents the proportion of successful
classifcations above or below the logistic regression-derived LRP, relative to the total number
classifcations or years. Out-of-sample cross-validation methods can also be applied so that
model-based LRPs do not include the observed data used for evaluation in this performance
metric.

We used a single metric of annual spawner abundances to approximate CU status when using
the logistic regression approach, though WSP assessments generally use multiple metrics
including trends in abundances and apply generational smoothing. Incorporating metrics on
trends and smoothing abundance time-series prior to determining CU status introduces autocorrelation
in observed CU statuses, violating the assumption of independent observations in the logistic

23

regression model. This creates a systematic difference in derivation of LRPs depending on how
CU status is assessed. Future research could consider logistic regression models that include
autocorrelated residuals to develop LRPs based on CU-statuses derived from multiple metrics
(e.g., the Pacifc Salmon Status Scanner).

One advantage of logistic regression LRPs is that uncertainties in CU-level benchmarks and
assessments can be accounted for explicitly. We used a statistically integrated estimation approach,
where CU-level stock-recruitment models and associated CU-level benchmarks were estimated
in the same model as the logistic regression and LRP derivation. In this way, the uncertainties
from CU-level benchmarks and assessments were propagated through to the estimation of the
LRP. While Bayesian estimation methods were not applied for the integrated logistic regression
approach in any of our case study applications, this extension could be made in the future.

In addition, structural uncertainties in underlying assumptions such as the form of the spawner-
recruitment relationship, can be addressed in at least three ways. First, the weight-of-evidence
for various assumptions can be evaluated to identify the assumption with the most support,
which is then used for LRP development. This can include relying on support for various model
forms provided in previous stock assessments or from meta-analyses. Second, various assumptions
can be provided as sensitivity analyses demonstrating the impact of assumptions about CU
dynamics on LRP estimates and current status. Third, LRPs can be averaged by, for example,
combining posterior probability estimates. When averaging, LRPs can be weighted according
to the inverse of the variances, the strength of evidence for each hypothesis based on statistical
criteria (e.g., AIC), retrospective performance, or expert opinion (Rossi et al. 2019; Jardim et al.
2021). A simple example of model-averaging, in which two alternative models were weighted
equally, was demonstrated for projection LRPs in the Interior Fraser Coho case study. When
model averaging, it is important to consider the plausibility of various models and the distribution
of uncertain parameters (e.g., their variances and biases)(Millar et al. 2015; Dormann et al.
2018). It may be more appropriate to select one model instead of averaging over models when
they provide competing hypotheses (i.e., bimodal distributions) with differing management implications
(Millar et al. 2015).

Alignment with LRP Principles

Logistic regression LRPs do not use the best available information for CU statuses in all cases
(Principle 1), because they use only one metric of spawner abundances omitting metrics on
trends which may be especially informative in data-limited contexts. CUs that do not have abundance-
based benchmarks are omitted from consideration of serious harm in this approach even when
trends are available to estimate status. Also, logistic regression LRPs approximate CU status
by comparing annual spawner abundances to benchmarks instead of generationally smoothed
spawner abundances and so may capture random noise in abundance trends instead of true
status that is likely autocorrelated over time. In some cases, status based on the single metric
on spawner abundances may diverge from that based on multidimensional approaches, e.g.,
the Pacifc Salmon Status Scanner. Logistic regression LRPs are aligned with Principle 2 to the
extent that serious harm is indicated by status of any one CU being in the Red zone under the
WSP and that the estimated relationship between aggregate abundances and probability of all
CUs being above their lower benchmark holds.

Logistic regression LRPs are operational (Principle 3) when harvest management occurs at
the aggregate level and requires aggregate abundance LRPs to inform management decisions.
However, they are more diffcult to communicate being derived from model outputs, and they

24

require the choice of probability of all CUs being above their lower benchmarks, which is diffcult
to justify from a science perspective.

Reliability of estimation (Principle 4) depends on the reliability of underlying data and the ft
of logistic regression as described by model diagnostics. One assumption of this method is
that the relationship between aggregate abundance and CU-level status observed historically
represents the current (and future) relationship. If the covariance in dynamics among CUs or
relative productivities or capacities of CUs are non-stationary, a phenomenon that is increasingly
common for Pacifc salmon, logistic regression LRPs may not reliably represent serious harm
under current or future conditions. Furthermore, LRPs may be unreliable if harvest strategies
change over time such that relative exploitation of CUs varies (e.g., due to shifts towards weak
stock management or when exploitation varies with the abundance of other species). Uncertainties
in CU status are accounted for explicitly when CU- and SMU-level models are statistically integrated,
and confdence or credible intervals can provide quantitative measures of estimation uncertainty
(Principle 5). Logistic regression LRPs are aligned with Principle 6 to the extent that aggregate
abundances are an acceptably reliable predictor of CU level statuses, with the caveat that CU
status on a single metric may deviate from the multidimensional approach recommended under
the WSP.

Projection LRPs

Similar to logistic regression LRPs, projection LRPs rely on the underlying relationship between
aggregate abundances and status of component CUs. However, unlike logistic regression LRPs,
the aggregate abundance where there is a specifed probability of all CUs being above their
lower benchmarks is identifed from projections instead of directly from historical data.

In this approach, the population dynamics of individual CUs are projected with natural variability
in population processes (e.g., recruitment and ages-at-maturity) and with covariance among CUs.
Projections are done using current exploitation rates characterized with annual implementation
uncertainty. Other exploitation scenarios can also be considered. Projections are run over an
initialization period to remove the impacts of starting conditions, and then over multiple generations
to identify aggregate abundances characterized by an equilibrium state where the distribution of
abundances are stable. Projection LRPs are then estimated using these projected CU abundances
to characterize the relationship between aggregate SMU-level spawner abundance and the
probability that all CUs exceed their lower benchmarks (e.g., Sgen). For the SMUs we considered
for our case studies, we approximated the management approach with constant exploitation
rates with implementation error, though more realistic management procedures that include
escapement goals and exploitation limits, or a fxed series of exploitation rates that vary with
abundances could be considered in future iterations. As was done for logistic regression LRPs,
status was estimated from a single metric rather than from the multidimensional approach within
the Salmon Scanner.

One advantage of projection LRPs over logistic regression LRPs is that projections allow for
explicit consideration of uncertainty in underlying assumptions about model parameters and
the covariance among CUs by including those uncertainties as random components of the
projections. Furthermore, unlike logistic regression LRPs, this method is not limited by historical
data on CU status. To implement projection LRPs, we adapted a previously developed R package
for performing closed-loop simulation modelling, samSim (Holt et al. 2020; Freshwater et al.
2020), as described in the Appendix to Holt et al. (2023) and provided online (see Appendix B).

25

After providing parameter distributions describing the CU-level population dynamics and exploitation
to samSim, the projections included four main steps:

1.  Project spawner abundances forward for 30 years after an initialization period and over

nT rial stochastic simulations, where nT rials was chosen to stabilize results. In preliminary
analyses, we projected over 100 years and found similar results.

2.  For each simulated year-trial combination after initialization, characterize abundances as

follows:

•  Assign aggregate SMU level spawner abundance for each year-trial combination to an

abundance bin based on intervals of 200 fsh, e.g., 0:200, 201:400, 401:600, etc.

•  Determine whether all CUs for each year-trial combination were above their CU-level

lower benchmarks on abundances, or not.

3.  For each aggregate abundance bin, calculate the proportion for year-trial combinations

where all CUs were above their lower benchmark relative to all year-trial combinations falling
in that bin. These proportions are then plotted against the aggregated abundances for year
bin (taken as the mid-point of the bin).

4.

Identify the LRP as the mid-point of the aggregate abundance bin with a proportion of CUs
above their lower benchmark that is closest to the desired probability threshold (e.g., 0.5,
0.66, 0.9, or 0.99).

Examples of projection LRPs derived from the aggregate abundance of each bin plotted against
the proportion of year-trial combinations where all CUs were above their lower benchmark are
shown in Figure 5. The choice of 200 fsh bins was a trade-off between increasing smoothness
of the curve with bins covering smaller range in aggregate abundances and computational
limitations of small bins requiring a very large numbers of stochastic simulations to allow for
a suffcient number of year-trial combinations within each bin to stabilize results. Also, for our
case studies, 200 fsh was within the range of uncertainty in observed spawner abundances.
Similar to logistic regression LRPs, the uncertainty in CU benchmarks and status are explicitly
accounted for in projection LRPs when deriving the probability of all CUs being above their lower
benchmarks. However, unlike logistic regression LRPs, there is no estimation uncertainty in
projection LRPs because statistical model estimation is not required. Probabilities are derived
directly from projections and underlying uncertainties are integrated directly into the overall
probability. Therefore, confdence intervals are not provided.

Also, similar to logistic regression based LRPs, structural uncertainty in underlying population
dynamics can be considered through sensitivity analyses or model averaging by combining
results from stochastic random trials across those structural assumptions. See our implementation
for Interior Fraser Coho Salmon in Holt et al. (2023) for more details.

Alignment with LRP Principles

As for logistic regression LRPs, projection LRPs use only one metric (annual spawner abundances),
and therefore do not necessarily use the best available information (Principle 1) if CU statuses
can be estimated using other metrics. Also similar to logistic regression LRPs, projection LRPs
represent levels above serious harm (Principle 2) as indicated by status of any one CU being
in the Red zone under the WSP, given the projection-based relationship between aggregate
abundances and probability of all CUs being above their lower benchmark.

26

Figure 5. Example of projected probability curve derived from projections over 30 years and 10,000 MC
trials. The curve shows the projected proportions of year-trial combinations where all CUs were above
their lower benchmark as a function of aggregate SMU abundance, where aggregate abundances are
shown in bins of 200 fsh. Each dot in the curve represents a single combination of year and simulation
trial. Coloured lines represent candidate LRPs calculated for 4 different probability thresholds, 0.5 (yellow),
0.66 (blue), 0.90 (green), and 0.99 (orange). Horizontal dotted lines intersect the y-axis at each probability
threshold, while the solid vertical lines show the corresponding aggregate escapement that represents the
LRP.

Also similar to logistic regression LRPs, projection LRPs are operational (Principle 3) when
harvest management occurs at the aggregate SMU level and requires an aggregate abundance
LRP to inform decisions. However, this form of LRP may be more diffcult to communicate being
derived from projections under assumptions of equilibrium, and they require choosing the probability
for all CUs being above their lower benchmarks, a choice that is diffcult to justify on purely
a scientifc basis. Reliability of estimation (Principle 4) depends on the underlying parameter
distributions and model structure capturing the plausible range of true underlying dynamics.
As with logistic regression LRPs, uncertainties can be propagated from CU-level benchmarks
and status to LRPs (Principle 5). Unlike logistic regression LRPs though, this method can also
integrate plausible ranges or future expectations of parameter and structural uncertainties that
may differ from those observed historically. Similar to logistic regression LRPs, projection LRPs
are aligned with Principle 6 to the extent that aggregate abundances are a reliable predictor
of CU level statuses, with the caveat that CU status on a single metric may deviate from the
multidimensional approach recommended under the WSP. Similar to logistic regression-based
LRPs, projection-based LRPs are aligned with Principle 6 to the extent that aggregate abundances
are able to reliably predict CU-level statuses.

5.  GUIDELINES FOR APPLYING LRPS

5.1.  STEPWISE APPROACH FOR SELECTING LRPS

KEY POINTS:

•  We recommend a step-wise approach for developing LRPs that highlights the

important steps, considerations and decisions when identifying LRPs. These steps
form our guidelines on the choice and implementation of candidate LRP methods.

•  Step 1. Compile data
•  Step 2. Assess CU data defciencies
•  Step 3. Evaluate if data-defcient CUs be represented by CUs with data
•  Step 4. Identify what proportion of CUs above red status (among those with data) is

required to avoid serious harm. We recommend 100% as the default.

•  Step 5. Assess SMU status relative to CU status-based LRP
•  Step 6. Peer-review status relative to CU status-based LRP
•  Step 7. Identify if aggregate abundance LRPs are required for fsheries management.
•  Step 8. If yes, estimate aggregate abundance LRPs and evaluate the extent to which

underlying assumptions are met.

•  Step 9. If yes, apply aggregate abundance LRPs to derive SMU-level status.

We recommend a step-wise approach for identifying LRPs, with the proportion of component
CUs with status above Red as the default method (Fig. 6). This is the method recommended
to meet the Fisheries Act requirement for LRPs, and being based on the biological unit of CU,
can be applied to numerous aspects of salmon management, including hatchery, harvest, and
habitat management. Aggregate abundance LRPs are presented as an option for cases in which
they are required for fsheries management (e.g., locally or internationally), but are considered
supplemental to the proportion of CUs with status above Red. The step-wise approach presented
below considers data availability for candidate LRP methods and provides guidance when inconsistencies
in status occur from applying multiple LRP methods. These steps can be adapted in the future
as more methods are developed and/or these methods are further applied and evaluated across
additional SMUs and contexts. These steps were developed to be consistent with the principles
described in Section 3.

5.1.1.  Step 1: Data Compilation

The frst step is to compile CU-level data to support biological status assessments as described
under the WSP (Holt et al. 2009; Holt et al. 2018). These data include (but are not limited to)
time-series of spawner abundances, recruitment, hatchery contributions, productivity, and biological
benchmarks on spawner abundances. This step generally includes aggregating data at the
spawning site or stream level to the CU level.

In some cases, fner spatial scales than CU (e.g., watersheds or sub-populations within CUs)
may be considered to defne serious harm to an SMU. Although CUs are the population unit
of assessment and conservation required under the WSP, the distribution of spawning within
CUs (e.g., among watersheds or sub-populations) can be an important component of status
(Holt et al. 2009) and these fner scales can be considered when data or supporting information
allows. Distribution is a commonly cited component of salmon viability and recovery (McElhany
et al. 2000). When applied to the identifcation of recovery targets for Pacifc salmon, Bradford

28

Figure 6. Steps for setting LRPs and assessing status. Pale yellow boxes indicate those for estimating CU
status-based LRPs. Blue boxes indicate those for aggregate abundance LRPs. White boxes indicate when
aggregate abundance LRP methods are not recommended.

and Wood (2004) defned the relevant scale of distribution in units of sub-populations that are
demographically independent, where population dynamics of one sub-population is unlikely to
affect the dynamics of another. Genetic exchange among sub-populations is expected to occur
at greater rates than observed among CUs (or populations), and would likely exceed 10 effective
migrants per generation. When applying these criteria to Interior Fraser River Coho salmon,
Bradford and Wood (2004) defned sub-populations on the basis of large watersheds or lakes, or
partial barriers to migration.

29

We recommend that the decision on distribution and spatial scale of conservation for biological
assessments be part of the peer-review process for CU and SMU assessments, and be based
on biological principles of conservation and viability (McElhany et al. 2000; e.g., as reviewed in
Bradford and Wood 2004).

Within this step, information on hatchery enhancement is used to identify populations where
production is dominated by hatchery-origin fsh. These populations (identifed by PNI values <
0.5, or expert opinion when data on the proportion of hatchery-origin spawners are not available)
are generally excluded from analyses, while those that are dominated by natural-origin fsh
(e.g., PNI values are ⩾ 0.5), are generally included (Withler et al. 2018). Further, where time-
series of the proportion of hatchery-origin salmon on the spawning grounds are available and
production is dominated by natural-origin fsh, these proportions can be used to generate time-
series of natural-origin recruitment for benchmark estimation and natural-origin spawners for
status assessment against benchmarks. When the infuence of hatchery production is removed
in this way, the assessments are less sensitive to the presence of hatcheries and annual variation
in hatchery practices.

Inflling among streams or spawning sites for years with missing data is commonly used when
compiling CU-level spawner abundance series (e.g., see Grant et al. 2012; Brown et al. 2020).
When inflled time series are used to estimate LRPs and monitor stock status relative to LRPs,
consideration should be given to the scale at which inflling is done. If LRPs are based on maintaining
CU-level diversity, inflling of missing data should generally not be based on escapements from
outside of the CU. Inflling among CUs increases uncertainty and may provide misleading status
for the CU being inflled, if CUs diverge in status and trends (see Step 3). In addition, hatchery
enhancement should be carefully accounted for when inflling to avoid overestimating abundances
when inflled numbers are based on sites that are artifcially enhanced and when enhancement
levels vary during the time series.

5.1.2.  Step 2: Assessing CU Data Defciency

Second, CUs with data to support biological assessments are identifed; those without suffcient
data are considered data defcient. CUs are assessed based on a variety of metrics including
abundances and trends, and data requirements for these metrics vary. At a minimum, a CU must
have an index of spawner abundance time-series. These data can be used to estimate trends
over time against benchmarks that are common across CUs (Holt et al. 2009). For short-term
trend analyses, data are considered insuffcient when they include less than half of available
years in the last three generations or are of low quality representing only presence/absence.
These criteria for trend detection are similar to criteria described in Brown et al. (2020) and
applied to spawning sites of Chinook Salmon in Southern BC.

In addition, current spawner abundances can be compared to abundance-based benchmarks,
where current spawner abundances are generally defned as the geometric average spawner
abundances over the most recent generation. For this metric, at least one year of spawner
abundances is required in the current generation to compare against benchmarks. CU-specifc
benchmarks on spawner abundances can be derived from spawner-recruitment models, percentiles
of spawner time-series, or habitat characteristics. Data requirements for benchmark estimation
on spawner abundances differ according to the methods applied and are not explicitly defned
here. Local biological expertise is required to review available data and benchmarks prior to
assessments to identify data defciencies. For example, changes in environmental conditions

30

over time may result in historical data that are no longer representative of current conditions,
resulting in data defciencies.

5.1.3.  Step 3: Determine whether status of data-defcient CUs can be inferred from CUs

with data

Third, the extent to which status of data defcient CUs can be inferred from CUs with data is
evaluated. By defnition, data defcient CUs do not have data on population dynamics to rigorously
evaluate the extent to which other CUs with data could be used to represent their status, though
information on threats and biological characteristics may be available. To infer status for data
defcient CUs, at a minimum we recommend providing evidence that: (i) the threats impacting
data defcient CUs are likely to be the same as for CUs with data and their magnitudes are
similar, (ii) dominant environmental drivers are similar among CUs, e.g., as refected by the
distribution of CUs across freshwater and marine ecosystems, (iii) biological characteristics, such
as life-history type and dominant age-at-maturity of data-defcient CUs are represented in the
CUs with data, and (iv) the carrying capacity of data defcient CUs is likely in the range of those
represented by CUs with data. Evidence supporting these criteria should be clearly documented
and reviewed by local experts. The burden of proof is to identify that data defcient CUs have
similar properties to neighbouring CUs, with the default assumption that each CU represents
unique biodiversity whose status and trends cannot be represented by other CUs. We provide an
overview of the four criteria in Table 4 and describe each one in more detail below.

Threats are defined here as any human activity or process that causes harm, death, or behavioural
changes to a species, or the destruction, degradation, and/or impairment of its habitat, to the
extent that population-level effects occur (DFO 2014). CUs that are exposed to different threats
in freshwater and marine environment within an SMU may diverge in biological characteristics
such as survival, growth, and reproductive success and therefore statuses and trends.

CUs can vary in their exposure to environmental conditions, related to variability in freshwater
and marine ecosystems, macroclimate, and hydrology within an SMU. Although SMUs are
usually defined to be spatially cohesive groups of CUs, differences in environmental conditions
among neighbouring CUs can result in differences in status and trends.

CUs with similar life-history characteristics are more likely to respond to common threats and
environmental drivers in the same way compared to those with divergent characteristics.
Differences in life-history characteristics have evolved among CUs as a consequence of exposure
to different environmental conditions and food availability (e.g., Bourret et al. 2016). In some
cases, SMUs have been defined to align CUs with similar life-histories (e.g., Fraser Chinook
where SMUs are defined in part based on dominant ages at maturity and adult run timing). In
other SMUs, CUs with various life-history types are combined based on their geographic location
(e.g., the Mainland Inlet Chinook SMU which contains CUs with ocean- and stream-type fish).

CUs with different carrying capacities may respond differently to similar threats. For example,
very small CUs may be more vulnerable to moderate fishing pressure if abundances decline
below critical conservation thresholds (e.g., 1500 fish, an abundance threshold within the Pacific
Salmon Status Scanner), whereas larger CUs may be more resilient to common threats.

32

Covariation in intrinsic productivity is well documented among spatially proximate populations
across Pacifc salmon species (Peterman et a l. 1998; Pyper et a l. 2002; Dorner et a l. 2018),
providing some support for the use of data-rich CUs to inform CUs without data. In a meta-
analysis of spawner time-series across Pacifc salmon species throughout BC using data extracted
from the Pacifc Salmon Explorer Tool (Pacifc Salmon Foundation 2020), pairwise correlations in
spawner abundances among CUs within SMUs tended to be positive (Appendix C, Fig. C.1).

Overall, we suggest caution when representing SMU status with only a subset of CUs, and
recommend evaluating and documenting the risks of incorrectly assigning status of data defcient
CUs based on neighboring CUs. We also recommend further quantitative evaluation of these
criteria using empirical data disaggregated into groups of CUs with similar environmental conditions,
life-history types and management intensity, among other variables. These criteria are not meant
to be prescriptive, but are intended to provide general guidelines for drawing inference for data
defcient CUs.

If data-defcient CUs do not meet the criteria for inference from the remaining CUs within an
SMU, we recommend collection of CU-level data to inform biological assessments. Data collection
would therefore be prioritized for CUs that diverge in threats, environmental drivers, life-history
characteristics and/or carrying capacities from neighbouring CUs.

In order to apply CU status-based LRPs, a lower limit on the proportion of CUs above Red status
needs to be defned. DFO (2009a) indicates that LRPs are based on biological criteria identifed
by Science, independent of management processes. Given the goal of the WSP is to protect the
biodiversity of Pacifc salmon in part by maintaining CUs above lower biological benchmarks, we
have identifed a threshold of 100% of CUs above Red status as an LRP that will avoid serious
harm. Exceptions to this LRP may occur where there is uncertainty or misidentifcation in the
delineation of CUs (e.g., as for some transboundary CUs, Holtby and Ciruna 2007) or CUs are
designated extinct. Those CUs would be omitted from the total number of (extant) CUs within the
SMU.

This step omits decisions about how to prioritize CUs for conservation given variability in their
capacity to rebuild. For some CUs the potential for rebuilding to above the Red zone may be
extremely low due to natural conditions or anthropogenic threats. For example, some CUs are
naturally more vulnerable to threats because of their biological characteristics (e.g., limited
habitat availability) placing them in the Red zone. However, that natural vulnerability does not
diminish the serious harm associated with the biodiversity loss if that CU is lost. Rebuilding
may also be limited due anthropogenic threats such as climate change. Recent vulnerability
assessments indicate that many salmon populations will not be resilient to climate change
in the coming decades (Crozier et al. 2019, 2021). These considerations can be identifed in
rebuilding potential analyses to inform decisions about where resources should be allocated in
any subsequent rebuilding plan that is developed (e.g., Carwardine et al. 2019).

Furthermore, unlike many other marine fsheries, threats and management levers for Pacifc
salmon extend beyond those associated with the fsheries that underlie the defnition of SMUs
and LRPs. The scale of SMUs is often incongruent with the scale of dominant threats and management
levers. As a result, LRPs based on 100% of CUs being above Red status may trigger the development
of rebuilding plans under the Fish Stocks provisions when only a component (e.g., a single CU)
requires intervention. Furthermore, the most appropriate CU-level interventions may not be

33

related to harvest (e.g., hatcheries or habitat amelioration). Nevertheless, we have identifed
100% of CUs within the SMU should be above their benchmarks to avoid serious harm under the
Fish Stocks provisions. Triggers and interventions at fner and coarser spatial scales will also be
essential to sustain Pacific salmon.

5.1.5.  Step 5: Assess

elative to a CU status-based LRP

We recommend CU status-based LRPs as the default approach for identifying LRPs for Pacifc
salmon. This method provides consistency with assessments previously published under the
WSP (Grant and Pestal 2013; DFO 2015; DFO 2016b; Grant et al. 2020a) and allows for the
evaluation of status at a hierarchy of scales relevant to salmon rebuilding .

Using this approach, the status of individual CUs is assessed and the proportion of CUs with
status above Red is then compared to the LRP identifed from Step 4  . Where available, we
recommend applying CU assessments from recent peer-reviewed WSP status assessments,
in which multiple metrics, such as abundances and short- and long-term trends, are integrated
to assign CU status within an expert-driven process (Holt et al. 2009; DFO 2015; DFO 2016b;
Grant et al. 2020a). As a general guideline, we suggest that ‘recent’ should mean within the most
recent generation, though major perturbations such as landslide events may make even recent
assessments unrepresentative of current status.

Because formal, peer-reviewed WSP status assessments are resources-intensive processes
involving large groups of experts over multiple days (Grant and Pestal 2013) and are not available
for most CUs, we demonstrate the application of a tool to quickly determine status, the Pacific
Salmon Status Scanner (Pestal et al. In
status depends on a variety of population metrics, where the choice of metrics depends on data
availability and may differ among CUs within an SMU. The Salmon Scanner integrates status on
available metrics to derive an overall status that is comparable among CUs.

). Within this multidimensional framework, CU

prep.

Status of SMUs with data-defcient CUs

CU status-based LRPs are considered breached when at least one CU has Red status regardless
of whether the status of component data-defcient CUs can be inferred from data-rich CUs or not
(Table 5, right column). A single CU with Red status can trigger a rebuilding plan under the Fish
Stocks provisions since improved monitoring of data-defcient CUs alone will not result in an
increase in SMU status to 100% (all CUs above Red status). Further monitoring of data-defcient
CUs is still warranted in this case to inform status of remaining components of the SMU and
associated rebuilding efforts.

Provisional SMU status

When data defcient CUs are represented by CUs with data we refer to the resulting status as
‘provisional’ if all CUs included in the assessment are above Red status (Table 5). This status
has higher uncertainty and is therefore considered provisional until all component CUs can be
assessed directly. In some cases natural variability alone may result in unassessed CUs having
Red status even if the criteria listed for CU representativeness in Step 3 are met.

Data-defcient S MU status

In contrast, where data defcient CUs are not represented by CUs with data (i.e., criteria in Step
3 are not met), and all CUs included in the assessment are above Red status, then the SMU is

34

considered data defcient and SMU status cannot be evaluated. In this case, we recommend
improved monitoring and assessment to fll CU-level assessment gaps.

5.1.6.  Step 6: Peer-review of

elative to CU status-based LRP

We recommend peer-review of the CU data and assessments used in steps 1 (Data compilation),
2 (Assess CU data defciency) and 5 (Assess status relative to CU status-based LRP) if CU
assessment are developed outside of an existing published, peer-reviewed process. Also, we
recommend peer-review of decisions on SMU-scale aggregation from steps 3 (Representation of
data-defcient CUs) and 4 (Proportion of CUs required to be above Red s tatus). This peer review
can occur, at least in part, through DFO’s State of the Salmon Program’s annual implementation
of the Pacifc Salmon Status S canner. The Salmon Scanner will be applied annually as part of
a process integrating outputs with local expertise to provide statuses for CUs. Expert review is
required to vet statuses derived from the application of the Salmon Scanner to ensure they are
consistent with underlying biological categories given the multiple and sometimes conficting
dimensions of status. The outputs from that process can be the basis for developing CU-level
statuses to inform SMU-level LRPs. We emphasize the importance of documented, peer-review
of LRPs and status assessments of SMUs prescribed under regulation, either as part the annual
application of the Salmon Scanner or in any separate SMU-specifc peer-review p rocess. Peer
review could be documented, for example, in a CSAS Research Document, CSAS Science
Response, and/or CSAS Science Advice Report.

The frequency of SMU-scale peer reviews outside of the annual implementation of the Salmon
Scanner will depend on variability in CU-level population dynamics over time and how LRPs and
SMU-level assessments are used to inform decision making (e.g., if an SMU is batched under
the Fisheries Act), among other factors. In the future, management procedures with various
frequencies of assessments could be evaluated in a simulation framework to identify risks of
delaying assessments relative to costs of implementing them.

Although CU status-based LRPs may meet requirements under the Fish Stocks provisions for
Pacifc salmon, abundance-based LRPs may be needed for fsheries management decisions
(Section 2.2). For SMUs where harvest at the aggregate scale is a dominant driver of population
dynamics and restricting fsheries harvest is a principal management lever, an LRP along the
metric of SMU-level abundances may support precautionary management. For example, when
LRPs are used to inform a harvest control rule, fshing pressure can be gradually curtailed as
aggregate abundances decline towards the LRP to avoid depletion below that level. Aggregate
abundance-based benchmarks may in some cases be required for local or international management.
For example, aggregate escapement goals are required for Nass and Skeena Sockeye under
Pacifc Salmon Treaty provisions (2019), although to comply with WSP objectives, the aggregate
escapement goal must consider CU-level diversity.

However, when LRPs are defned within the context of a Management Procedure framework
(Section 2.2), then an aggregate abundance LRP may not be required if the framework can
demonstrate the probability of individual CUs having status above Red for various management
options. For Pacifc salmon, management procedures may extend beyond harvest control rules
to include time-area closures, gear restrictions, habitat enhancement or hatchery supplementation
to protect individual CUs. Therefore, the choice to develop an aggregate abundance LRP depends
on the decision context, and should be made in collaboration with various sectors and First
Nations responsible for management decisions that affect the SMU. If aggregate abundance
LRPs are not required, assessment of the SMU would be provided from steps 1-6. The following
steps (8-9) are relevant if aggregate abundance LRPs are required, and build on CU status-
based LRPs derived in the previous steps. Uncertainties introduced by the inclusion of models
to relate aggregate abundances to CU-level statuses should be considered when choosing LRP
methods (Principle 5 in Section 3).

In the context described here, aggregate abundance LRPs are scientifcally derived quantities
that delineate serious harm to an SMU following the principles outlined in Section 3. In particular,
aggregate abundance LRPs are defned to be consistent with the WSP objective of maintaining
biodiversity at the scale of CUs. Although these LRPs can inform harvest control rules, harvest
management decisions require consideration of multiple objectives beyond those associated with
conservation and serious harm (e.g., socioeconomic objectives).

What is an Acceptable Probability of CU Statuses Being Above Red?

To defne aggregate abundance LRPs, frst, an acceptable probability of having all component
CU statuses above Red is identifed. While a 100% or nearly 100% probability of all component
CUs being above Red may be desirable from a conservation perspective, inherent uncertainties
in population dynamics make this choice impractical. Often, LRPs above the highest observed
aggregate spawner abundances are required to achieve a near 100% probability of components
being above Red status. Instead, we recommend applying a probability of at least 50% of all
CUs being above Red status to align with WSP objectives. As outlined in Section 4, we provide
LRPs associated with a range of probabilities, 50%, 66%, 90%, and 99% (where analytically
possible) derived from categories of likelihoods used by the International Panel on Climate
Change (Table 3, Mastrandrea et al. 2010), instead of specifying a single probability. We distinguish
the probability of all CUs being above Red from the proportion of  CUs above Red (identifed
as 100% in Step 4). Both CU status-based and aggregate abundance LRPs are set at levels

36

where all CUs are above Red status, but aggregate abundance LRPs assign a probability to this
occurrence.

Although DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework (2009) states that LRPs under the Fish
Stocks provisions be identifed by Science, we were unable to identify a specifc probability level
for all CUs being above Red status that aligned with scientifc p rinciples. Although it may be
possible to select a probability level based on the IPCC likelihood categorization scheme (e.g.,
more likely than not, likely, very likely, virtually certain) further guidance on choosing among
these options is required.

Choose among aggregate abundance LRPs

Guidelines for choosing among two types of aggregate abundance LRPs are described here:
logistic regression LRPs and projection LRPs. These methods use either historical or projected
data, respectively to identify the relationship between aggregate abundances and the probability
that all CUs are above Red status. The guidelines presented at this step are based on the separate
assumptions required for each method. If assumptions are not met for either method, then
developing aggregate abundance LRPs that are aligned with the WSP may not be possible for
the SMU.

Both methods rely on an assumption of positive covariation in population dynamics among
component CUs. If this assumption is met, then when one CU has depleted status and contributes
relatively few spawners to the aggregate, it is likely that other component CUs will also have
depleted status contributing few spawners to the aggregate. Similarly, if one CU is considered
healthy and contributes many spawners, other CUs are more likely to be healthy.

Given the range of uncertainties and limitations associated with each method, the application
and comparison of both methods may be prudent instead of limiting analyses to a single approach
(see Step 9).

Logistic Regression LRPs

Empirical logistic regression LRPs are derived from historical time-series of the proportion of
CUs above Red status, indicated by a single metric on spawner abundances or distribution.

LRPs based on logistic regressions may be appropriate when the following assumptions are met:

•  CU assessments are derived primarily from abundances relative to benchmarks or distribution
of spawners instead of time trends, or status on spawner abundances relative to benchmarks
are considered a suitable approximation. It is possible to combine two or more types of
abundance-based benchmarks to assess CUs within an SMU (e.g., use both percentile and
Sgen  benchmarks to assess different CUs).

•  As required for CU status-based LRPs, data-defcient CUs meet criteria outlined in Step 3

such that their status can be represented by CUs with data.

•

•

Time-series of the proportion of CUs above the lower benchmark contain contrast such that
all CUs are above their lower benchmark in at least one year and at least one CU is below
its lower benchmark in at least one year.

There is a statistically signifcant positive relationship between aggregate abundances
and log-odds of all component CUs being above their lower benchmark without infuential
outliers, as supported by model diagnostics described in Holt et al. (2023). This relationship

37

tends to be signifcant and positive when pairwise correlations in spawner abundances
among CUs are strong and positive. For example, for our case study on Interior Fraser
Coho, goodness-of-ft diagnostics identifed a signifcant relationship between aggregate
abundances and log-odds of all component CUs being above their lower benchmarks (p<0.01)
and the average pairwise spawner correlations among CUs was relatively high, 0.56. In
contrast, for our case study on Inside South Coast Chum, Oncorhynchus keta, the same
goodness-of-ft diagnostic was not statistically signifcant (p=0.13) and average pairwise
spawner correlations was relatively weak, 0.12.

•  Residuals for logistic regression model ft are independent (i.e., not temporally autocorrelated).

•  Environmental drivers and threats among CUs have remained stable over the available time-
series, or have changed in the same way across CUs such that covariance in population
dynamics among CUs is likely to have remained stable over time. As a result, the relationship
between aggregate abundances and log-odds of all CUs being above lower benchmarks is
also likely to have remained stable.

•  CU-level population dynamics are not undergoing directional changes resulting in declines

or increases in population dynamic parameters and associated benchmarks.

In preliminary analyses for the Interior Fraser Coho case study, we considered CU status based
on multidimensional status from the Salmon Scanner, but have chosen to focus on the single
metric approach for several reasons. First, the Salmon Scanner includes status on smoothed
abundance data (running generational geometric mean) relative to abundance-based benchmarks,
and therefore the status in one year depends on the status in the previous year. Autocorrelation
violates the assumption of independence of observations required in the logistic regression.
Although logistic regressions can be revised to account for autocorrelated residuals, when autocorrelation
is detected the available degrees of freedom are often insuffcient given the relatively short time-
series of CU assessments. In addition, the Salmon Scanner includes metrics on short- and long-
term trends in spawner abundances which are less directly related to, and may be completely
unrelated to, aggregate abundances. For CUs that rely on time trends for status assessments,
aggregate abundance-based metrics are likely not appropriate (see below).

LRPs based on logistic regressions may not be appropriate when:

•  CU assessments are derived from trends in spawner abundances over time (e.g., as part of

the Salmon Scanner), and not abundance-based benchmarks.

•  Data-defcient CUs do not meet criteria outlined in Step 3 such that their status cannot be

represented by CUs with data.

•

•

Time-series of the proportion of CUs above their lower benchmarks lack contrast (i.e., are
equal to 100% for all years, or less than 100% for all years).

The relationship between aggregate abundances and log-odds of all component CUs being
above their lower benchmark is not statistically signifcant or contains infuential outliers. In
other words, model diagnostics do not support the use of logistic regression.

•  Residuals for logistic regression model ft are temporally autocorrelated such that status in

one year depends on the status in the previous year.

•

Threats and/or environmental drivers have changed such that CU-level benchmarks estimated
from historical data are no longer meaningful, and there is no expectation that these changes
will revert naturally to their preexisting state, or be achievable through management. Or,

38

environmental drivers and threats among CUs have changed over the available time-series
such that covariance in population dynamics among CUs is likely to have changed.

•

There is only one CU in the SMU. In this case, the CU-level status represents the SMU-level
status.

Projection LRPs

Projection LRPs are derived from projections of CU-level population dynamics and associated
time-series of CUs above Red status as indicated by a single metric, spawner abundances
relative to a lower benchmark. CU status derived from multidimensional assessments within
the Salmon Scanner were not considered for projection LRPs because the projection model
identifes long-term equilibrium aggregate abundances associated with specifed probabilities
of component CUs being above lower benchmarks and is not structured to refect time trends.
Time trends can be assessed in simulation models that evaluate the impacts of management
procedures on population dynamics from current status, as in MSEs.

Projection LRPs may be appropriate when:

•  CU-specifc stock assessment models have been developed including parameterization
of spawner-recruitment models and the covariance in recruitment residuals among CUs.
These models and their parameters account for hatchery contributions when populations
are infuenced by hatcheries, are peer reviewed, and represent current dynamics of natural
spawners and recruitment.

•  Where peer-reviewed population dynamics parameters are not available or are no longer
current, plausible bounds can be placed on uncertain parameters (e.g., productivity and
capacity), including those that may have changed over the time-series to represent a best-
estimate of current conditions. These bounds can be derived from neighbouring CUs, meta-
analyses, or expert opinion.

•

These CU-specifc parameters are available for representative CUs within the SMU (as
identifed in step 3)

Projection LRPs may be inappropriate when:

•  Population dynamics parameters cannot be estimated, and/or plausible ranges are not

known.

•  Projection LRPs are used to evaluate status under a new management procedure that is not

considered in the projection model. Projection LRPs depend on the specifc management
procedure applied in the projections, implemented as a constant exploitation strategy for our
case studies. However, sensitivity analyses of projection LRPs to various exploitation rates
or management procedures can demonstrate aggregate abundances required to maintain
CUs above their lower benchmarks under a variety of possible management scenarios, and
the sensitivity of management choice to the aggregate abundance LRP.

•

There is only one CU in the SMU. In this case, the CU-level status equates to the SMU-level
status.

Furthermore, projection LRPs may be more appropriate when pairwise correlations in spawner
abundances among CUs are positive and strong, but this is not a requirement. It is possible to
estimate projection LRPs for an SMU with component CUs that vary independently. However,

39

when correlations between CUs are low, the aggregate abundance LRP will be high because
there is a higher probability of any one CU having Red status. In these cases, CU status-based
LRPs and harvest control rules that manage CUs independently may be more appropriate.
Although higher LRPs under asynchronous dynamics may initially be counter-intuitive due to
the stability asynchrony provides to aggregate time-series (Schindler et al. 2010), independent
trajectories among components increases risks of individual component CUs dropping below
lower benchmarks in mixed-CU fsheries necessitating higher LRPs.

Model evaluation for projection LRPs is more subjective than for logistic regression LRPs. The
suitability of logistic regression model fts can be evaluated using statistical model ft diagnostics,
which makes the evaluation process relatively objective and repeatable. However, the added
assumptions and analytical decisions required to parameterize projection models is a more
subjective process in which outcomes may vary among analysts. Peer review, as described
in step 6 above, will be required to support the development of projection LRPs.

5.1.9.  Step 9: Apply aggregate abundance LRPs to derive SMU-level status and compare

to status against CU status-based LRPs

Aggregate abundance methods are then applied to derive LRPs based on the guidance above.
See Appendix A and Holt et al. (2023) for example applications. When status of an SMU is
inferred from aggregate abundance LRPs using a subset of CUs that are considered representative
of the remaining data-defcient CUs, then the resulting status should be considered ‘provisional’
(i.e., with increased uncertainty) until the status of all component CUs can be assessed. When
status of data-defcient CUs cannot be inferred from data-rich CUs, status cannot be assessed
with aggregate abundance LRPs.

We use generational mean spawner abundances as a basis for determining whether the SMU is
above or below its LRP. A generational mean integrates status over cohorts within a generation,
which are generally independent of each other because of the anadromous, semelparous life-
history of Pacifc salmon and the dominance of a single age-at-maturity for many stocks (Holt et
al. 2009; Porszt et al. 2012). As a result, generational smoothing reduces noise in annual CU
status determination arising from both interannual variability in CU abundances from different
cohorts and annual observation error in estimated spawner abundances. It also makes our
determination of LRP status consistent with the approach taken for abundance-based benchmarks
in published WSP assessments (e.g., Grant et al. 2020a) and the Salmon Scanner at the CU
level. Further, we recommend that SMU status be evaluated approximately every salmon generation
to align with guidance for generational CU assessments under the WSP (Grant and Pestal 2013;
Grant et al. 2020a).

Compare Aggregate Abundance LRPs

Using multiple analytical approaches to defne LRPs is consistent with the principle of using the
best available information if evidence to support one method over the other is lacking. Statuses
that converge among methods provide a stronger weight-of-evidence that the chosen LRP
represents a level above where serious harm may occur. Although LRPs that converge may be
based on assumptions that are coincidentally incorrect, the principle of Occam’s razor supports
explanations with fewer exceptions. When LRPs diverge, the underlying assumptions causing
those divergences should be explored and further reviewed.

Compare Status from Aggregate Abundance LRPs to that from CU status-based LRPs

In this step, we recommend comparing status from aggregate abundance LRPs to that obtained
from CU status-based LRPs identifed in Step 5 . While aggregate abundance LRPs exploit
observed covariation in population dynamics among component CUs, several factors can lead
to a break-down in that relationship (e.g., observation errors, temporal variation in covariation,
and/or infrequent extreme events). Hence, statuses from aggregate abundance LRPs may
differ from those based on CU status-based LRPs. We recommend CU status-based LRPs
as the default LRP to implement the Fish Stocks provisions, with aggregate abundance LRPs
supplemental where required for harvest management purposes.

6.  DISCUSSION

6.1.  KEY UNCERTAINTIES THAT AFFECT LRP ESTIMATES

KEY POINTS:

•  Uncertainties in CU-level benchmarks affect both CU status-based and aggregate

abundance LRPs, and can arise because of:
•  observation errors in underlying data, e.g., related to uncertainty in the hatchery

contribution to spawning,

•  estimation uncertainty in benchmarks arising from statistical model ftting and

time-varying parameters, and

•  structural uncertainties in model forms.

•  Uncertainties can also arise in CU statuses due to the choice of metrics used (single
or multidimensional). For both aggregate abundance LRPs, uncertainties can arise
because CU-level status is based on only a single metric as a proxy for status on
multiple dimensions.
The distribution of spawning among populations within a CU can be important for the
viability of the CU and SMU, and ignoring or misidentifying this stock structure may
increase uncertainty in assessed status.

•

•  Uncertainties in all the candidate LRPs can arise from the exclusion of data-limited

CUs from analyses when these CUs are poorly represented by the data-rich CUs that
are included. We recommend caution when applying LRPs that do not include all CUs.

•  Uncertainties in logistic regression LRPs arise from statistical estimation of the

stock-recruitment and logistic regression models, as well as changes in population
parameters and covariance among CUs over time.

•  Uncertainties in projection LRPs can arise from mis-specifying models used in the

•

projections.
For projection LRPs, uncertainties in underlying parameters and CU-level benchmarks
are integrated into the probability of all CUs being above their lower benchmarks, and
the LRP itself does not have statistical estimation uncertainty. Projection LRPs
explicitly account for underlying uncertainties in population parameters, such as
CU-level productivity and capacity, age-structure, covariance in recruitment deviations,
and variability in implementation of exploitation strategies over time and among CUs.

41

6.1.1.  CU assessments

Uncertainties in CU-level benchmarks affect both CU status-based and aggregate abundance
LRPs, and arise because of observation errors in underlying data, estimation uncertainty in
benchmarks, and structural uncertainties in model forms. Each of these three sources of uncertainty
in benchmarks are described here.

First, data uncertainties can arise from observation errors in spawner abundances, the proportion
of hatchery-origin spawners, catches, stock assignment of catches, and age-at-maturity. These
uncertainties impact estimates of recruitment in ‘run reconstructions’ and assessment of status.

In particular, the impact of hatcheries on spawner and recruitment time-series is a key uncertainty
due to the low rates of marking hatchery salmon and sampling on the spawning grounds. Even
when data on the proportion of hatchery-origin fsh are available and abundance time-series
are adjusted to account for these (as in the Interior Fraser River Coho case study), the genetic
impacts of hatcheries can perpetuate over multiple generations (Araki et al. 2009; Christie
et al. 2014), and are diffcult to quantify because second generation hatchery-origin fsh are
not marked or monitored. This is a source of uncertainty for populations impacted by within-
basin (or within-population) hatchery facilities as well as those impacted by straying out-of-
basin. Targeted marking and monitoring of spawning grounds for mark proportions and genetic
analyses to identify genetic introgression from strays would help address these uncertainties.
Further, for populations that are not dominated by hatchery production, the decision to exclude
the contribution of hatchery-origin fsh from time-series of spawner abundances where possible
assumes that these fsh do not contribute to assessment and resulting management of wild
salmon, as in previous WSP assessments (e.g., DFO 2015), despite their possible contribution
to conservation and rebuilding objectives, and ecosystem services in general. A review and
evaluation of objectives for integrated-transition and integrated-wild populations (with PNI ⩾ 0.5),
and the appropriate data on which to base assessments was beyond the scope of this project.

Second, in the estimation of benchmarks, statistical uncertainties can be represented with 95%
confdence intervals derived analytically or with bootstrapping (or 95% credible intervals for
Bayesian analyses). Short time-series or those with insuffcient contrast in spawner abundances
can increase estimation uncertainties in benchmarks. For stock-recruitment based benchmarks
in particular, observation errors in spawner abundances can bias benchmark estimates (‘errors-
in-variables’), as can correlations that occur when the spawner abundance in a given year depends
on recruitment in the previous generation (time-series biases, Walters and Martell 2004). Uncertainties
in percentile-based benchmarks can arise because of uncertainties in productivity and harvest
rates required to categorize populations for benchmark identifcation (as described in Holt et al.
2018). Uncertainties in benchmarks derived from the watershed-area model (Parken et al. 2006;
Liermann et al. 2010) may arise due to its parameterization based on spawner-recruit data sets
that are outdated (ending in 2000) and likely more productive compared with populations used in
our case study. To address this last source of uncertainty, we derived productivity estimates and
uncertainties from a life-stage specifc model for WCVI Chinook combined with expert opinion.
All of these benchmarks may be biased when underlying population parameters change over
time and these changes are not refected in the estimation procedure (see Section 6.3 for more
details).

Third, structural uncertainty in stock-recruitment models underlying benchmark estimation can
swamp other sources of uncertainty, and requires careful consideration based on available
data and biological understanding of the population dynamics, ideally with peer review. We
provide one example of structural uncertainty in the Interior Fraser River Coho study based on

42

prior assumptions about population capacity, but other components, such as decisions about
depensation at low abundances, shared or independent variability in productivity among CUs,
and strength of over-compensation (e.g., Ricker versus Beverton-Holt) should be considered.

In addition to uncertainties in benchmarks, uncertainties can arise in estimated CU statuses
due to assumptions made during status assessment. Uncertainty in status can result from the
choice of metrics used (single or multidimensional). In some cases, status is best represented by
a composite of multiple metrics resulting in uncertainties in status when only a single metric (e.g.,
spawner abundances) is applied. Furthermore, the distribution of spawning among populations
within a CU can be important for the viability of the aggregate, and ignoring or misidentifying this
stock structure may result in higher uncertainty in assessed status. Uncertainties can also arise
from applying stock-recruitment based benchmarks to spatial scales that are larger or smaller
than the scale at which density dependence occurs.

Uncertainties in peer-reviewed WSP assessments are captured qualitatively, as documented in
narratives associated with each CU assessment (e.g., DFO 2015). These qualitative estimates
of uncertainty are derived from experts who integrate uncertainties in data and benchmarks
and often reconcile conficting m etrics. This process requires careful consideration of expertise
included to ensure that best available information is incorporated in assessments and associated
description of uncertainties. Although uncertainties in CU status derived from the Salmon Scanner
are not currently provided, this functionality is being considered for future iterations of the tool.
The Salmon Scanner will be applied annually within an expert-driven process led by DFO’s State
of the Salmon Program, so underlying uncertainties are considered and outputs are verified. A
full review of the Salmon Scanner including uncertainties is forthcoming (Pestal et al. In

).

6.1.2.  CU status-based LRPs

Uncertainties in status derived from CU status-based LRPs can arise from the exclusion of
data-limited CUs from analyses when these CUs are poorly represented by the data-rich CUs
that are included. To clearly communicate this uncertainty, we suggest labeling these LRPs as
provisional when all the data-rich CUs have status above Red. Even when data-limited CUs have
similar threats, environmental conditions and drivers, life-history characteristics and capacities
as the data-rich CUs, population dynamics may diverge due to other processes that are not
accounted for. We recommend caution when applying provisional LRPs that do not include direct
information from all CUs. In these cases, we recommend implementing a monitoring program to
inform CU-specifc assessments.

6.1.3.  Aggregate Abundance LRPs

Logistic regression LRPs

For logistic regression LRPs, uncertainties can arise from statistical estimation of the stock-
recruitment and logistic models. In our case studies, we provide 95% CIs and assess their
overlap with current status. These CIs represent uncertainty in the estimation of the logistic
regression incorporating uncertainty in the underlying benchmarks (e.g., from spawner-recruitment
relationships or the watershed-area model). This occurs because the estimation of the logistic
regression model was statistically integrated with the estimation of the underlying spawner-
recruitment based benchmarks. This statistical integration allows uncertainties to be propagated
from CU-level benchmarks to SMU-level LRPs. When estimated in a Bayesian framework, the
probability distribution of LRPs can be generated to provide the probability that the current
status is above the LRP given uncertainties in the LRP. In future analyses, uncertainty in current

43

spawner abundances could be integrated with uncertainty to derive probabilities of breaching
LRPs that accounts for both sources.

Similar to CU status-based LRPs, uncertainties in logistic regression LRPs can arise from the
exclusion of data-limited CUs from analyses when these CUs are not well represented by the
data-rich CUs that are included. Further uncertainties in logistic regression LRPs can arise if
the management system has changed over time such that selectivity from fsheries among CUs
has diverged, or if the covariance in population dynamics has changed due to natural or other
anthropogenic factors. In some cases, covariance among CUs may be driven by synchronous
trends in hatchery enhancement creating misleading and possibly biased LRP estimates.

Furthermore, uncertainties in both aggregate abundance LRPs (logistic regression and projection
LRPs) can arise because these LRPs are derived from CU statuses on a single metric as a
proxy for status on multiple dimensions. In some cases, these statuses may diverge because
of additional metrics considered and the generationally smoothed time-series used to assess
current status in the multidimensional approach (as implemented by the Salmon Scanner).

Projection LRPs

Projection LRPs explicitly account for underlying uncertainties in population and harvest parameters,
such as CU-level productivity and capacity, age-structure, covariance in recruitment deviations,
and variability in implementation of exploitation strategies over time and among CUs. The inclusion
of structural uncertainty in the form of different stock-recruitment relationships is demonstrated
for the case study on Interior Fraser Coho. We recommend a thorough review of assumptions
and either including them directly in random sampling in projections or including them as sensitivity
analyses.

One caveat of this approach is that the LRP depends on the management procedure applied in
the projections, implemented as a constant exploitation strategy for our case studies. Although
management procedures for Pacifc salmon often include escapement goals, fxed exploitation
limits, and/or a fxed set of exploitation rates that vary with abundances, we have assumed that
these procedures can be roughly approximated with a constant exploitation rate with implementation
error. Other more realistic management procedures could be considered in future iterations.
Projection LRPs derived in this way cannot be used to assess status when management procedures
change over time and those changes have not been evaluated in projection.

One difference between projection and logistic regression LRPs is that for projection LRPs,
uncertainties in all underlying parameters and CU-level benchmarks are integrated into the
probability of all CUs being above their lower benchmarks, so that the LRP itself does not have
statistical uncertainty associated with it. In contrast, 95% CIs associated with logistic regression
LRPs account for estimation uncertainty not included in projection LRPs.

When considering both logistic regression and projection LRPs under alternative model assumptions,
such as different formulation of the stock-recruitment model, LRPs can be chosen based on
strength of evidence for underlying assumptions or averaged when alternative assumptions are
all equally plausible. Care should be taken when there is little or no overlap in the distribution
of LRPs under various model assumptions, where averaging can obscure different plausible
realities that would require alternative management actions.

6.2.

IMPACT OF MISSING CUS ON SMU-LEVEL STATUS

KEY POINTS:

•

For CU status-based LRPs when an SMU contains data-deficient CUs and the
remaining data-rich CUs are above Red Status, we recommend SMU status be either
provisional (i.e., status with higher uncertainty) or data deficient.

o

o

  SMU status is provisional when data-rich CUs are deemed representative of
data-deficient CUs
  SMU status is data-deficient when data-rich CUs are not representative of
data-deficient CUs

•  Also for CU status-based LRPs, when any component CU has Red status, we

recommend SMU status be assessed as below the LRP regardless of the presence of
data-deficient CUs and whether the status data-deficient CUs can be inferred from
data-rich CUs.
For aggregate abundance LRPs, we recommend that SMU status be provisional
when SMUs contain data-deficient CUs that can be inferred from data-rich CUs,
regardless of the status of the data-rich CUs.

•

For CU status-based LRPs, we recommend SMU status be either provisional (i.e., status with
higher uncertainty) or data defcient when an SMU contains data-defcient CUs and the remaining
data-rich CUs are above Red Status. This recommendation is based on the potential for positive
biases in status based on the data-rich CUs alone. Provisional status can be assigned to SMUs
where the data-rich CUs are representative of data-defcient CUs (refecting high uncertainty
in status), and data-defcient SMU status can be assigned where the data-rich CUs are not
representative (Table 5). The power to detect a breach of a CU status-based LRP is relatively
weak when the sample size of the data-rich CUs is small relative to the total number of component
CUs. Therefore, statuses that rely on only a small number of CUs within an SMU tend to provide
more optimistic status than those that include a larger sample of CUs for CU status-based LRPs,
as shown for Inside South Coast Chum case study.

In contrast, if the LRP of 100% of CUs above Red status has been breached for an SMU with
data-defcient CUs, the inclusion of additional CUs may further deplete or improve status defned
as the percentage of CUs above Red status, but will not change the fact that the LRP has been
breached. This asymmetrical impact of increased monitoring of CUs on SMU status may reduce
incentives to extend monitoring to data-defcient CUs.

For aggregate abundance LRPs we recommend that SMU status be provisional when SMUs
contain data-defcient CUs that can be represented by data-rich CUs regardless of the status of
the data-rich CUs. For these LRPs, we found that removing component CUs from assessment
of an SMU tended to increase variability in SMU-level status, which may be more pessimistic or
optimistic than when all CUs are considered depending on which CU is removed and the level
of covariation among CUs. For logistic regression LRPs in particular, the removal of CUs affects
the ft of the logistic regression model, which impacts estimated status relative to LRPs in ways
that are diffcult to predict a priori, as shown for the Interior Fraser Coho case study. In addition,
for aggregate abundance LRPs we recommend data-defcient status for SMUs with component
data-defcient CUs that cannot be inferred from the data-rich CUs.

6.3.  FUTURE RESEARCH

KEY POINTS:

•  We recommend future research be prioritized to evaluate the impacts of:

o

o

o

  Temporal trends in underlying population processes such as intrinsic productivity
and carrying capacity on biological benchmarks and reference points.
  Adapting LRPs to include a broader scope for serious harm, including ecosystem
and habitat considerations, the distribution of spawning within CUs, and Indigenous
Knowledge.
  Simulation evaluation of LRP methods given temporal variability in population
parameters and other sources of uncertainty.

We recommend future research on the impacts of time-varying parameters, adapting LRPs to
include a broader scope for serious harm, and the evaluation of LRP methods, as described in
more detail below. We highlight time-varying parameters due to their pervasiveness in Pacifc
salmon population dynamics and documented impacts on reference points.

6.3.1.

Time-varying parameters and impacts on LRPs

There is increasing evidence of time-varying population processes in Pacifc salmon populations,
particularly relating to trends in productivity (Peterman and Dorner 2012; Malick and Cox 2016;
Dorner et al. 2018). In Canada, DFO assessments have identifed declines in productivity for
various CUs, e.g., Fraser River Sockeye (Grant et al. 2012; Grant and Pestal 2013; Huang et al.
2021), Southern BC Chinook (DFO 2016b), and Interior Fraser River Coho (Arbeider et al. 2020).
These assessments relied on a variety of tools to identify trends in productivity including the
evaluation of trends in recruits per spawner (Arbeider et al. 2020) and residuals from recruitment
curve fts (Grant et a l. 2012), and explicit consideration of time-varying parameters when ftting
recruitment curves using Kalman flter or recursive Bayes approaches (Huang et a l. 2021).
However, determining support for time-varying parameters is not always straightforward. Common
statistical diagnosis such as inspection of residuals and use of information criteria (e.g., AIC and
BIC) often produce conficting results (Holt and Michielsens 2 020). Evidence for changes in
capacity over time are encountered less often in Pacifc salmon populations, but the potential
impacts of time-varying capacity have been explored in simulation studies and may be important,
although it is usually less impactful than changes in productivity (Holt 2010; Dorner et al. 2013).
Changes in population demographics, such as size at age and age-at-maturity are also known
to infuence population dynamics and reference p oints. Failure to track interannual changes in
age-at-maturity can lead to biased stock-recruitment parameter estimates and underestimation
of model variance (Bradford 1991; Zabel and Levin 2002).

Time-varying recruitment parameters and population demographics affect estimates of salmon
benchmarks, e.g., SMSY  and Sgen  (Holt and Michielsens 2020; Staton et al. 2021) and are also
likely to affect population trends, resulting in changes to benchmarks based on historical observations
(e.g., percentile-based benchmarks, Holt et al. 2018). Analytical methods for time-varying reference
points have been proposed for other marine fsh species (A’mar et a l. 2009; Punt et a l. 2014),
some of which have been evaluated empirically and in simulation with mixed results (Berger
2019; O’Leary et al. 2020). Berger (2019) suggests that dynamic reference points that track
changes in underlying population processes are most useful in situations when stock productivity
shifts directionally and the productivity signal is correctly ascertained. In contrast, uncertainty

46

from incorrectly identifying productivity trends can be a major source of inaccuracy in stock
status (Berger 2019).

Although evidence for time-varying population processes is strong, guidance on incorporating
these changes into assessment and management of Pacifc salmon are lacking. In a review
of stock-recruitment analyses for Pacifc salmon, Adkison (2021) highlighted that even when
there is strong evidence for non-stationarity in population dynamics it is not clear if reference
points should be adjusted accordingly. Where stock depletion is associated with time-varying
parameters that are thought to be reversible, it may be more appropriate to protect the population
from harvest by maintaining reference points using all historical data (DFO 2013; Szuwalski and
Hollowed 2016). DFO (2006) recommended that changes to reference points should only occur
when there is considerable evidence that productivity has changed and there are no expectations
that these changes will be reverted naturally or achieved through management. Furthermore,
DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework states that “when developing reference points efforts
should be made to take into consideration the range of factors which may affect the productivity
of the stock including changes in ocean conditions, where information is available”(DFO 2009a).
This information can help identify if reductions in productivity are likely to be reversible or only
slowly reversible. Klaer et al. (2015) devised a framework for evaluating the degree of confdence
in productivity shifts in Australian fsheries, and similar approaches could be adapted for Canadian
salmon populations.

Even if time-varying benchmarks or reference points are considered, it is diffcult to defne how
often they should be changed (Zhang et al. 2021a). Mistimed changes in benchmarks or reference
points may lead to biases in stock status and volatility of management responses may lead to
management uncertainty, reducing trust in the management process (Adkison 2021). Recent
studies recommend the use of case-specifc feedback simulation exercises in order to determine
the appropriate scale to adjust reference points when stock-recruitment parameters are non-
stationary (Holt and Michielsens 2020; O’Leary et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2021b). However, full
feedback simulation studies might not be feasible for every CU where trends are suspected due
to limited resources.

Further research identifying when and how to account for time-varying parameters and demographics
in assessments and management of Pacifc salmon is warranted, and is currently underway
within DFO. Current WSP assessment methods do not consistently account for time-varying
dynamics and their impacts on status and the resulting LRP estimates. Guidance on accounting
for time-varying parameters that differ among CUs within an SMU is also warranted. Time-
varying stock-recruitment dynamics usually occur at the CU level, and the implications for SMU-
based LRPs that contain multiple CUs are not straightforward. There are no clear guidelines
on how to translate time-varying stock-recruitment parameters for CUs into aggregate-level
LRPs. Effects of time-varying CU recruitment dynamics on aggregate abundance and CU status-
based LRPs will depend on the degree of synchrony among CUs, the direction of the change in
recruitment parameters, and past and current stock status, among other factors. For example, in
our case study on Interior Fraser River Coho Salmon, when a consistently lower productivity level
was introduced through an alternative stock-recruitment model formulation (one that included
informative priors on capacity in CU-level spawner-recruitment models), benchmarks increased
for most CUs as did the aggregate abundance-based LRP for the SMU. However, in cases where
productivity varies at different rates among CUs or capacity changes as well, impacts on CU-
level benchmarks and SMU-level LRPs will not be easily predictable.

47

6.3.2.

Adapting LRPs to include a broader scope of serious harm

We recommend future research into LRPs that consider the ecosystem component of serious
harm for Pacifc salmon and include longer time frames for assessing thresholds of serious
harm. The ecosystem component of serious harm could be considered by accounting for the
importance of Pacifc salmon populations for marine ecosystems (Nelson et a l. 2019; Walters et
al. 2020; Trochta and Branch 2021) and the impacts of salmon migration on the infow of marine-
derived nutrients into freshwater and estuarine ecosystems (Schindler et al. 2003; Hocking and
Reimchen 2006; Field and Reynolds 2011; Quinn et al. 2018). While the defnition of serious
harm under DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework encompasses impacts to the ecosystem,
associated species and a long-term loss of fshing opportunities (DFO 2009a), the assessment
of harm to these components depends to some extent on the time frame being considered.
Assessments that include only very recent data may miss large declines in status and ecosystem
impacts that occurred historically before the advent of modern survey records. In some cases,
considering a longer view from genetic, archeological, palaeoecological, or Indigenous Knowledge
has demonstrated that recent declines are part of much larger historical declines associated with
large-scale ecosystem impacts (McKechnie et al. 2014; Eckert et al. 2018; Lee et al. 2019; Price
et al. 2019).

Indigenous Knowledge has been considered in the development of target reference points for
fsheries management (Caddy and Mahon 1995), and there is value in further considering its
role in identifying serious harm. Reid et al. (2021) introduce the concept of Two-Eyed Seeing
(Etuaptmumk in Mi’kmaw), where both Indigenous and Western science perspectives are valued
through the process of, “learning to see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous knowledges
and ways of knowing, and from the other eye with the strengths of mainstream knowledges and
ways of knowing, and to use both these eyes together, for the beneft of a ll”. By investigating
serious harm, reference points, and the time-varying nature of these concepts from both Indigenous
and Western scientifc perspectives, LRPs may better refect biological processes underlying
both knowledge systems. This step requires engagement and collaborate with Indigenous
Peoples to co-lead and co-produce research on pairing Indigenous Knowledge with Western
science-based LRPs.

In addition, the distribution of spawning within CUs is a component of CU assessments under
the WSP, but robust metrics and benchmarks of distribution are lacking. Future research on
assessment methods that more rigorously considering population structure within CUs would
beneft both CU assessments under the WSP and assessments relevant to First Nations who
often rely on salmon populations at relatively fne spatial scales.

Alternative LRP methods may be developed in the future to capture a broader range of data
availability, quality, and types, and dimensions of biological status, aligned with the key principles
in Section 3. As methods are developed and revised, SMU statuses can also be updated in
accordance with Principle 1, using the best available information for the development of LRPs.

6.3.3.

Evaluation of LRP methods

We recommend further consideration and evaluation of the four proposed criteria to identify
if data-limited CUs can be inferred by data-rich CUs (Step 3, Section 5). For example, these
criteria (and/or other considerations) could be applied to SMUs where CU statuses are available
to assess the extent to which statuses covary when CUs are deemed representative of each
other. Simulation evaluation could further evaluate the extent to which CU statuses on a single

48

metric of status covary under a range of plausible underlying covariance structures in recruitment,
age-at-maturity, and exploitation rates.

In addition, we recommend simulation evaluation of logistic regression LRPs and projection
LRPs to assess impacts of data limitations related to the number of CUs with data and assumptions
about population dynamics and covariance among CUs. We recommend that these evaluations
be parameterized to the SMUs where their application is proposed to ensure results are relevant
to the specifc context under consideration.

When applying methods to specifc case studies, we recommend that aggregate abundance
LRPs consider major structural uncertainties either through sensitivity analyses or model ensemble
approaches. These analyses can determine how sensitive aggregate abundance LRPs are to
key model uncertainties, including those related to time-varying parameters, depensation at low
abundances, observation errors, and covariance in both population dynamics and vulnerability to
harvest. We emphasize the critical importance of this step considering a wide range of hypotheses
about underlying dynamics. Indeed, standard stock-recruitment models may have limited use if
they do not capture the dynamics currently observed. In addition, we recommend simulation
evaluation to assess the robustness of LRPs to violating underlying analytical assumptions.
Simulation evaluation could further be used to assess the frequency of updates to LRPs required
to achieve objectives given underlying changes in model parameters and structure.

APPENDIX A. CASE STUDIES

We illustrate the application of the candidate methods for LRPs developed in Section 4 to three
SMUs as case studies, evaluate sensitivity of LRPs to various assumptions, and use these
applications to inform the guidelines presented in Section 5. The case studies included Interior
Fraser River Coho Salmon, West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) Chinook Salmon, and Inside
South Coast Chum Salmon (excluding Fraser River CUs), each comprised of 3-7 component
CUs. These SMUs were chosen because they spanned a wide range of data types and availabilities
from data-rich (Interior Fraser River Coho) to data-limited (Inside South Coast Chum). Furthermore,
they varied in hatchery contributions from high (WCVI Chinook) to relatively low (Interior Fraser
River Coho and Inside South Coast Chum), and two of these case studies are included in the
proposed frst batch of stocks to be put under regulation for the Fish Stocks provisions (Interior
Fraser River Coho and WCVI Chinook). For each case study, the set of LRP methods considered
is a function of available data and previously developed assessment methods for component
CUs. In this section, we provide a brief description of each case study and methods applied
to each. For more complete descriptions of case studies, including SMU characteristics, data
sources, analysis methods, and results, see Holt et al. (2023).

A.1.

INTERIOR FRASER RIVER COHO

The Interior Fraser Coho Salmon Stock Management Unit (SMU) includes Coho Salmon that
spawn in the Fraser River and tributaries upstream of Hells Gate in the Fraser Canyon. This
SMU consists of 5 CUs: Middle Fraser, Fraser Canyon, Lower Thompson, North Thompson, and
South Thompson (DFO 2015). Declines in Interior Fraser Coho spawner abundance throughout
the 1990’s led to a suite of management actions to promote recovery, including signifcant fshery
restrictions starting in 1998 (Decker et al. 2014). Previous work by the Interior Fraser Coho
Recovery Team (IFCRT) identifed 11 subpopulations nested within the fve CUs, and developed
recovery objectives based on maintaining abundances of each sub-population above conservation
thresholds (Interior Fraser Coho Recovery Team 2006). In 2014, a peer-reviewed WSP status
assessment classifed three of these CUs as being amber status (Middle Fraser, Fraser Canyon,
South Thompson) and the remaining two CUs as amber/green status (Lower Thompson, North
Thompson) (DFO 2015). As part of the WSP assessment, Sgen  was estimated for each CU and
used as one of several benchmarks considered when determining integrated CU status.

We used data on total annual spawner abundances, recruitment by age (from natural spawning),
and hatchery-based smolt-to-adult survival rate indices covering return years 1998-2020 to
derive CU-level spawner-recruitment based benchmarks. Data on natural-origin spawner abundances
at each of the 11 sub-populations summed to CU level were used to assess status and trends at
the CU level for CU status-based and logistic regression LRPs. These data, along with exploitation
rates were used to parameterize the projection model for projection LRPs. Hatchery contribution
to production was usually small in this SMU, with PNI values >0.5, and usually >0.72. Spawner
abundances are positively correlated among CUs, with an average correlation of 0.56 (Figure A.1).
We characterized CU status in three ways, using: (1) the Pacifc Salmon Status Scanner, (2) CU-
level abundances relative to Sgen  as a lower benchmark on abundance derived from spawner-
recruitment relationship under the WSP, and (3) the distribution of spawning abundance relative
to distributional targets developed by the IFCRT (Interior Fraser Coho Recovery Team 2006).
In the second approach, we further considered two structural assumptions about the spawner-
recruitment relationship based on Korman et al. (2019) and Arbeider et al. (2020), which related

60

Figure A.1. Distribution of correlations in spawner abundances among CUs (or inlets for WCVI Chinook)
for the three case studies

to the strength of density dependence. The third approach recognizes that an adequate distribution
of spawners across subpopulations may be required for long-term persistence of the SMU
(Interior Fraser Coho Recovery Team 2006), and that a contraction of that distribution may
represent increased risk of extinction (Arbeider et al. 2020). While multidimensional approaches,
such as the Pacifc Salmon Status Scanner are recommended for WSP assessments (Holt
et al. 2009), we applied the other two approaches (2) and (3) to support the development of
aggregate abundance LRPs and for a point of comparison with the Salmon Scanner. Even
though aggregate abundance LRPs are not required for harvest management of this SMU, we
provide logistic regression and projection LRPs for demonstration purposes. Fisheries on Interior
Fraser Coho are managed under a bilateral Canada/US management regime, detailed in Annex
IV Chapter 5 of the Pacifc Salmon Treaty.

For this SMU, we evaluated the sensitivity of LRPs based on aggregate abundances to data
availability with a retrospective analysis by re-estimating CU-level benchmarks, CU statuses,
and SMU-level LRPs each year using only the data prior to that year. We also implemented a
sensitivity analysis where one or two CUs were removed from the analyses iteratively and CU-
level benchmarks, CU statuses, SMU-level LRPs, and SMU-level statuses were re-estimated.
We further ran sensitivity analyses related to structural assumptions about the stock-recruitment
relationship when deriving CU-level benchmarks for CU status-based and aggregate abundance
LRP methods.

We found that LRPs and resulting status were most sensitive to structural assumptions about
the shape of the stock-recruitment relationship. LRPs were less sensitive to LRP methods or
CU assessment approach (Pacifc Salmon Status Scanner versus single-metric on spawner

61

abundances versus single metric on distribution) or the addition of more years or CUs of data.
However, we note that for logistic regression LRPs, the exclusion of CUs resulted in larger uncertainties
in SMU-level status, though the 95% CIs of status usually overlapped with the status estimated
using all the data.

For this case study, we further demonstrated the approach of averaging over structural uncertainties
to provide a projection LRP that accounts for that uncertainty. Similar averaging is also possible
for logistic regression LRPs.

A.2.  WEST COAST VANCOUVER ISLAND CHINOOK

The WCVI Chinook SMU consists of three CUs (Holtby and Ciruna 2007), seven large inlets
(or sounds), and 20 escapement indicator populations distributed across the seven inlets and
three CUs. Escapement indicator populations are those with relatively complete time-series
of spawner abundances with consistent observation methodology (Riddell et al. 2002; Pacifc
Salmon Commission Sentinel Stocks Committee 2018). Hatchery enhancement is a substantial
component of many of these populations, however, only escapement indicator populations
without signifcant hatchery enhancement (PNI ⩾ 0.5) were included in our analyses (see Section 4).
Because time-series of the proportion of hatchery-origin spawners are not available for these
populations, total spawner abundances were used in the assessment of CU and aggregate SMU
level statuses, which may result in overly optimistic assessments of status relative to analyses
excluding hatchery-origin fsh (as in the Interior Fraser River Coho case study). Spawner abundances
tend to be positively correlated among inlets within the SMU, with an average correlation of 0.28
(Figure A.1).

For WCVI Chinook, inlets nested within CUs are considered an important spatial scale of biodiversity
given the geographic separation of spawning habitats among inlets, and limited straying observed
among inlets (D. McHugh pers. comm. DFO South Coast Stock Assessment). We therefore
considered spawner abundances at the scale of inlets within CUs because of expected limited
demographic exchange at this spatial scale.

Two of the three CUs in this SMU, WCVI-South and WCVI-Nootka & Kyuquot, were assessed as
Red status in a recent integrated Wild Salmon Policy assessment (DFO 2016b). WCVI Chinook
was identifed as a stock of concern in the 2021 Integrated Fisheries Management Plan (IFMP)
and a rebuilding plan is under development (DFO 2021e). Poor smolt-to-age-2 survival for WCVI
Chinook and low spawner levels over the past two decades were highlighted as reasons for
conservation concern in the IFMP (DFO 2021e).

Biological benchmarks have been estimated for WCVI indicator populations using an empirical
relationship between watershed area and two stock-recruitment biological benchmarks, SREP
(spawner abundances at replacement) and SMSY, based on a meta-analysis of 25 Chinook
stocks across North America (Parken et al. 2006). Lack of rigorous recruitment data for WCVI
Chinook stocks precludes the use of stock-recruitment based benchmarks. For the development
of LRPs for WCVI Chinook, the empirical relationship between watershed area and SREP  was
re-estimated using a hierarchical Bayesian model (as in Liermann et al. 2010), and applied to
WCVI Chinook inlets.

We characterized CU status in two ways for this case study, using: (1) the Pacifc Salmon Status
Scanner, (2) CU-level abundances relative to Sgen  derived from watershed-area model estimates
of SREP  and productivity derived from a life-stage specifc survival model with expert opinion. We
calculated two types of LRPs: CU status-based LRPs and projection LRPs. Based on CU-level

62

assessments, there were no years in the historical data where all CUs were above the Red zone,
so it was not possible to identify logistic regression LRPs. Even though aggregate abundance
LRPs are not required for harvest management of this SMU, we provide projection LRPs for
illustrative purposes. Fisheries are managed based on a combination of the bilateral Canada-US
management regime specifed under the Pacifc Salmon Treaty and local co-governance. We
implemented sensitivity analyses on projection LRPs across two key uncertainties: variability
in exploitation among inlets and intrinsic productivity. Further analyses exploring impacts of
exploitation, variability in intrinsic productivity, and capacity are provided in Appendix D of Holt et
al. (2023).

We found that status was consistent across the LRP methods that were available, and with a
previously published assessment. However, projection LRPs were highly sensitive to underlying
population productivities. Although the base-case LRP assumes a relatively diffuse distribution
of productivities aligned with the range of expert opinion, reductions (by 25%) or increases (by
50%) in productivities among inlets resulted in relatively large changes in LRPs estimates.

A.3.

INSIDE SOUTH COAST CHUM - NON-FRASER

The Inside South Coast Chum - Non-Fraser SMU (hereafter ISC Chum) includes seven CUs of
chum salmon from rivers that drain into Johnstone Strait and the Salish Sea along the mainland
of British Columbia and the east coast of Vancouver Island. Chum salmon CUs spawning in
the Fraser River watershed are excluded from this SMU as they have been categorized as a
separate SMU (Inside South Coast Chum - Fraser). While these two SMUs have substantial
overlap in ocean fsheries, they have been separated into two SMUs based on differences in
terminal fsheries and freshwater habitats. Godbout et al. (2004) identifed variable but stable
status in the central and southern portions of this SMU, with declines in the north, especially in
the region defned by the Southern Coastal Streams CU component. Holt et al. (2018) found
similar results in a provisional WSP assessment of status. Spawner abundances tend to be only
very weakly correlated among CUs for this SMU, with an average correlation of 0.12 (Figure A.1).

The ISC Chum SMU is considered data-limited. While escapement time series are available for
many streams starting in 1953, several series are incomplete and require inflling assumptions
in order to produce a standardized data set over the full length of the time series. The quality of
recruitment data is not suffcient to reliably estimate parameters from stock-recruit relationships
for use in stock-recruitment benchmarks. Instead, benchmarks were calculated as a percentile
of the historical CU-level spawner abundance time series (percentile benchmarks) to inform
WSP status, as recommended by Holt et al. (2018). We removed three systems with high levels
of enhancement from the Georgia Strait CU (one with large hatchery production and two with
extensive artifcial spawning channels). The remaining systems had a mix of relatively small
hatchery production or no hatchery production (see Lynch et al. 2020). Where available, annual
estimates of hatchery-origin spawners were removed from total spawner abundances.

For this case study, we consider two approaches for characterizing CU status: (1) the Pacifc
Salmon Status Scanner and (2) a single-metric on spawner abundances using percentile-based
benchmarks. We applied both the CU status-based LRP and logistic regression LRPs to this
case study and evaluated the sensitivity of SMU-level status from CU status-based LRPs to
various data inputs. We were not able to generate reliable logistic regression LRPs for this SMU
because logistic regression models did not ft the data well, as shown by model diagnostics.

63

We found that assessments based on the Pacifc Salmon Status Scanner gave identical results
to the single-metric on spawner abundances relative to percentile-based benchmarks. Also,
as for Interior Fraser River Coho, increasing the number of CUs included in analyses always
resulted in more pessimistic statuses relative to the LRP.

AMONG CUS WITHIN SMUS

Figure C.1. Distribution of mean pairwise correlations between CUs for 40 SMUs of Pacifc salmon
arrange by species. Points are scaled to the number of CUs within a SMU with the largest point equal to
25 CUs.

In a meta-analysis of spawner time-series across Pacifc salmon species throughout BC, pairwise
correlations in spawner abundances among CUs within SMUs tended to be positive for Pink,
Chum, Coho, and Sockeye Salmon. For Chinook Salmon, correlations were more variable
among CUs and sometimes negative, in part due to the confounding infuence of hatchery
production in some of those systems. A pervasive problem with correlation analyses for Pacifc
salmon is that populations with available time-series tend to be more heavily managed or suitable
for less expensive spawner surveys, and may not represent those without data which tend to be
remote, expensive for spawner surveys, and without direct management interventions. Data are
taken from the Pacifc Salmon Explorer, provided by E. Hertz (Pacifc Salmon Foundation, July
2020). A link to the Github repository containing code to perform these analyses are provided in
