The Pacific Salmon Commission is charged with the implementation of the Pacific Salmon Treaty,
which was signed by Canada and the United States in 1985.  The focus of the agreement are salmon stocks
that originate in one country and are subject to interception by the other country.  The objectives of the Treaty
are to 1) conserve the five species of Pacific salmon to achieve optimum production, and 2) to divide the
harvests so each country reaps the benefits of its investment in salmon management.

Introduction

Fraser River sockeye and pink salmon are managed according to Chapter 4 of the Pacific Salmon Treaty
which has been in effect since 1985. Ensuring Treaty obligations are met and implementation is followed
correctly entails gathering data and information for assessment purposes. This is done in support of
Fraser River Panel management actions aimed at meeting objectives pertaining to (1) achieving
spawning escapement targets, (2) meeting international catch allocation goals and (3) meeting domestic
catch allocation objectives. As a result, data and information are collected throughout the year and
analyzed from the perspective of pre-season planning, in-season management and post-season review.
This technical report serves to document the pre-season and in-season assessment methods supporting
Fraser River Panel management of Fraser River sockeye salmon.

This technical report is a compilation of short chapters that document different data collection and
assessment methods for Fraser River sockeye salmon, with special reference to 2018 given the data
collection and assessment methods are most comprehensive on this cycle line. Each chapter can
potentially be used as a separate, stand-alone document or sub-report when wanting to provide others
with information on the topic and are also accessible in this format to Fraser River Panel and Technical
Committee members on the PSC SharePoint site or to others upon request. Each chapter/sub-report
contains all the technical details required to understand, critique and replicate the methods. This
includes among others an overview of the data and the methods used and planned changes or areas for
improvement. To ensure the accessibility of the individual chapters and prevent readers from being
overwhelmed by details, the individual chapters are restricted to about five pages. If the information on
a topic is too lengthy, it is spread over several chapters, either by providing first a more general
overview followed by one or more chapters that go into further detail (e.g., a chapter discussing the
overall hydroacoustic program at Mission followed by several chapters of the different components of
the hydroacoustic program), or by spreading one topic over several chapters (e.g., separate discussion of
marine versus in-river catchability estimates). The use of individual chapters as sub-reports allows more
flexibility in terms of adding additional documentation for new methods or revising documentation of
existing methods instead of republishing an entirely updated technical report. It is anticipated that
future published versions of this technical report will also incorporate post-season assessment methods
as well as methods to assess Fraser River pink salmon.

This technical report aims to inform members of the Fraser River Panel and technical committee,
academia and the general public about the different data collection and assessment methods for Fraser
River sockeye salmon. This report does not aim to provide the results of these assessments, which can
be found in the Fraser River Panel annual reports available on the PSC website (www.psc.org). Further
questions regarding this technical report and its content can be directed to info@psc.org.

Assessment Overview of Fraser River Sockeye

Annual pre-season planning of the fisheries management season for Fraser River sockeye starts by
gathering the necessary inputs for the PSC Planning Model (Chapter A6), a simulation tool used by the
Fraser River Panel to assess the ability of different fisheries plans to reach management targets given
the information and forecasts available preseason (Chapter A7). Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) provides
some of this information: run size forecasts for the different management groups (Chapter A1), marine
timing and northern diversion rate forecasts (Chapter A2), and the spawning escapement plan (Chapter
A4), while PSC Secretariat staff provide forecasts of test fishing catches (Chapter A5) and forecasted
estimates of en route losses, i.e., differences between predicted and observed escapement estimates
(DBEs, differences between estimates). The latter inform the Management Adjustment (MA, Chapter
A3) which refers to the additional fish added to an escapement target to increase the likelihood of
achieving that target. The Planning Model relies on a forward reconstruction with assumptions on fish
movement and migration behaviour (Chapter A8) as well as assumptions about the vulnerability of
sockeye to different fisheries operations (Chapter A9). The Planning Model helps create pre-season
fisheries schedules and assesses the sensitivity of fishery plans and the achievement of management
targets to alternative biological and management scenarios. This helps guide pre-season planning for
stakeholders and informs early in-season management prior to the availability of updated in-season
information.

In-season fisheries management relies on real time data of returning sockeye to adjust and refine
preseason fisheries plans and helps guide fisheries management decisions. One of the key data sources
in-season are the test fisheries (Chapter B1) that provide information on abundance, timing, and
diversion rates as well as species and stock composition information for use in stock assessments. Test
fishing occurs in marine approaches to the Fraser River (Johnstone Strait and Juan de Fuca Strait) and
within the Fraser River. While purse seine and gillnets form the main gear types used for quantitative
assessments, the PSC test fisheries also include troll/hook and line test fisheries to assess delaying
sockeye in the Strait of Georgia, and reef net test fisheries. One key data set collected by these test
fisheries is the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data (Chapter B2), which is used to estimate daily sockeye
abundances in the test fishing area. For marine test fisheries in Johnstone Strait and Juan de Fuca Strait,
the CPUE data along with an expansion line estimate (the inverse of the catchability coefficient) are used
to derive daily abundances (Chapter B4). At the start of the season, historical expansion line estimates
are applied, derived from data from past years. Because abundances predicted this way may deviate
substantially from the true abundance to the high variability in expansion lines, both between years and
within a season, expansion lines are updated once sufficient in-season observations have been obtained.
The abundance estimates based on marine CPUE data are considered early indicators of the expected in
river abundance given that it takes sockeye approximately 6 to 8 days to migrate from marine areas to
the Fraser River. In the Fraser River, daily sockeye abundance estimates are primarily based on
hydroacoustic data collected at Mission (Chapter B10). If Mission hydroacoustic data are unavailable or
unreliable to estimate sockeye abundance due to the dominance of other species, the CPUE data
collected at the Whonnock test fishing site can be used in combination with in-river expansion lines
(Chapter B3).

Fish caught by the test fisheries, and by commercial fisheries when they occur, are sampled on a regular
basis to collect a range of biological information used for in-season assessments (Chapter B5). Biological
information includes length, weight and sex information (Chapter B6). Length measurements can be
used to supplement stock identification and they are used as inputs into hydroacoustic models to
differentiate fish species. Weights are important for understanding fish condition and provide the fishing

5

industry with information on potential value of fishing opportunities. Biological samples also include
DNA and scales that are collected in a procedural manner to ensure up-to-date stock identification data
are available for each Panel meeting. Scale data (Chapter B7) provides information about fish age,
growth rate and stock identification when DNA estimates are not (yet) available. For stock identification,
scales are compared against scales of known stock origin using a linear discriminant analysis in
combination with a principal component analysis (Chapter B8). The output from this model provides
stock proportions for each sample and stock assignment probabilities for individual sockeye salmon.
DNA-based stock identification (Chapter B9) is however the preferred method for identifying salmon
stocks. DNA has been used by the PSC since 2002 and uses genetic profiles from fishery catches of
unknown stock composition and compares this to a genetic baseline with known stock origin using a
Bayesian statistical framework. The genetic identification of salmon stocks is essential for stock-specific
reconstructions to assess the total run size and timing by management group (Early Stuart, Early
Summer, Summer and Late run sockeye).

Another in-season assessment program operated by the PSC is a hydroacoustics program which provides
daily estimates of salmon passage in the Fraser River throughout the summer (Chapter B10). Because of
the large 400m river width, a combination of four hydroacoustic systems are deployed to adequately
monitor the salmon migration past the area. The left bank area, where most of the upstream migration
typically occurs, is monitored by a stationary split-beam system (Chapter B11) and an ARIS imaging
sonar (Chapter B13) deployed at the end of a fish deflection weir. The ARIS system collects more visually
intuitive data but only covers the first 30 meters of the left bank while the split-beam system extends
coverage by an additional 30m. The left bank ARIS system increases the accuracy of the left bank,
especially during periods of high abundance when the split-beam system has been known to
underestimate abundances. The nearshore right bank area is monitored using another ARIS imaging
sonar, covers up to 30 meters and typically observes less than 20% of the daily upstream salmon
migration. The remaining offshore region is monitored by a mobile, downward-looking split-beam
system deployed from a sampling vessel that transects the river (Chapter B14). The information
collected from the left-bank and mobile split-beam systems are input into a flux model to estimate fish
passage (Chapter B12). These estimates are combined with the data collected by the shore-based
imaging sonars to derive the daily salmon estimates. In addition to abundance information, the ARIS
systems on both the left and right bank also provide estimates of salmon species composition using a
mixture model based on acoustically observed fish lengths (Chapter B15).

The total salmon estimates when combined with species composition estimates provide daily sockeye
abundance information. Several different data sources and methods exist to derive species composition
(Chapter B16) and each has its own shortcomings depending on sample size and the number of species
migrating in the river at that time. The daily sockeye abundance estimates can be further split up into
abundance of the four different management groups through the application of stock proportion
estimates derived from test fishing catch samples taken in the same area (Chapter B17). Stock
proportion estimates are also applied to catch and CPUE data. The resulting stock-specific estimates of
catch and escapement past Mission are then used in reconstructions (Chapter B18), applied both
forwards and backwards. Forward reconstructions predict stock-specific escapement into the river
based on marine daily abundances derived from stock-specific CPUE data from marine test fisheries
combined with assumptions about migration speed and delay behaviour. Backward reconstructions add
stock-specific daily estimates of marine and lower river catches to stock-specific daily escapement
estimates to reconstruct the total daily abundance in marine areas. The resulting estimates are used to
derive the total run size, marine migration timing and diversion rate.

6

Prior to all sockeye salmon passing by the riverine hydroacoustic site, in-season run size and timing
estimates are obtained through the application of a Bayesian time-density model (Chapter B19) fit to
CPUE data from marine gillnet and purse seine test fisheries in Johnstone Strait and Juan de Fuca Strait
and reconstructed daily marine abundance estimates. For Harrison and Late run stocks that delay their
upstream migration, only marine CPUE are used to assess the run, resulting in larger run size uncertainty
in comparison to stocks that also rely on marine reconstructed data. Given the larger uncertainty
associated with these Late-run run size estimates and the fact they make up a substantial portion of the
total Fraser River sockeye run on the 2018 cycle line, two additional models are used on high abundance
years. One of these assessments is referred to as SMURFing (Smolt Method for Updating Run-size
Forecasts, Chapter B20) and relies on an in-season run size estimate for Early Thompson and relative
smolt abundance estimates collected two years prior for Late Shuswap/Portage versus Early Thompson
stocks to predict the run size for Late Shuswap/Portage. It assumes the same marine survival for Late
Shuswap/Portage as for Early Thompson. While it does not provide the final in-season run size for Late
run stocks, it does provide an early indicator if the run size is smaller or larger than the pre-season
forecast. The other assessment method employed on large Late run years relies on CPUE data of a troll
test fishery in the Strait of Georgia (Chapter B21) which helps estimate the number of Late run sockeye
delaying their upstream migration into the Fraser River. Information collected from this test fishery
provides an alternative run size estimate based on escapement into the Fraser River to date, estimated
number of delaying fish and estimated abundance seaward of the troll test fishery. Both these
assessment methods are only used on years with large Late-run abundances, i.e., Late Shuswap return
years, and help with the in-season planning of potential fisheries.

An additional component the Fraser River Panel considers when planning fisheries are potential en
route losses due to adverse migration conditions within the Fraser River. To increase the likelihood of
achieving spawning escapement targets for the four management groups, the Panel uses Management
Adjustments (MA, Chapter B22) which are the additional fish allocated to escape fisheries for the
purpose of increasing the likelihood of achieving these targets. To select appropriate MA values, the
Panel will take into account observed and predicted estimates of temperature and discharge within the
Fraser River (Chapter B23) and other factors that can cause adverse migration conditions and
differences between predicted and observed spawning ground estimates (DBEs, difference between
estimates). In-season DBE predictions for Early Stuart, Early Summer and Summer run sockeye are also
generated through a DBE temperature and discharge model (Chapter B24) where 19-day mean water
temperature and discharge observations in the Fraser River are related to historical DBE data. Late run
sockeye, excluding Birkenhead and Big Silver, traditionally delay their upstream migration. Early entry
into the Fraser River since 1995 has however resulted in extended freshwater residence times, increased
exposure to higher river temperature and discharge and increased mortality (Lapointe et al. 2003, Cooke
et al. 2004). The DBE run timing model (Chapter B25) to predict the DBE for these stocks relates
upstream migration timing to migration success, i.e., to DBE estimates. Early predictions of upstream
migration timing in turn are based on the historic relationship between the proportion upstream
migration to-date and upstream timing.

In-season fisheries opportunities are determined by the availability of International total allowable catch
(TAC, Chapter B26). This is calculated as the Fraser River sockeye abundance available after the
spawning escapement target (SET), the Management Adjustment (MA), the agreed Aboriginal Fisheries
Exemption (AFE) and the expected catch in panel authorized test fisheries are deducted. If there is
sockeye abundance available for harvest, the United States share will not exceed 16.5 percent of the
sockeye TAC. The remaining TAC in addition to AFE catches are assigned to Canada.

A1. Run Size Forecast

J.A. Gill, M.J. Hague, and A. Phung

Summary
Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) provides run size forecasts to the Pacific Salmon
Commission (PSC) as part of their obligations under the Pacific Salmon Treaty (Chapter 4,
Paragraph 4). Forecasted returns of Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) stocks
based on historical stock-recruitment data are a key input into pre-season planning for
fisheries. Prior to the start of the season, run size forecasts are used directly in calculations of
management objectives (e.g. spawning escapement targets, total allowable catch, Chapter A4)
and in simulations of alternative fishing scenarios (Chapter A6). These forecasts also play an
important role in the early in-season management of Fraser River sockeye salmon, prior to the
availability of updated estimates based on in-season information and are utilized throughout
the fishing season as informative prior distributions for stock assessment models (Chapter B19).

Individual return forecasts are generated for 27 component stocks, and then aggregated into
four management groups: Early Stuart, Early Summer, Summer and Late run. Run sizes are
forecasted using traditional stock-recruit models (e.g. Ricker, Larkin) unless recruitment data
are lacking, in which case average survival estimates from related stocks are relied upon (Cass
et al. 2006). Selection of the model used to forecast a stock is based on a retrospective
evaluation of the performance of the multiple models and subsequent ranking of the models
based on various performance and selection criteria. Given the uncertainty in the modelled
stock-recruit relationships, a Bayesian approach is used to generate posterior probability
distributions of run size for the various component stocks. Sensitivity of management decisions
to alternative run size scenarios can then be evaluated by drawing different quantiles from the
posterior distributions.

Introduction
Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) provides run size forecasts prior to the fishing season to the Pacific
Salmon Commission (PSC) as part of their obligations under the Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST 2020,
Chapter 4). Individual return forecasts are generated for 27 component stocks, and then aggregated into
four management groups: Early Stuart, Early Summer, Summer, and Late run. Despite the uncertainty
associated with run size forecasts based on historical stock-recruitment data, the forecasted
distributions of run size for different stocks and management groups of Fraser River sockeye play an
important role in the pre-season planning and in-season assessments of stock size. Run size forecasts for
Fraser River sockeye are a key input into DFO’s Integrated Fisheries Management Plan, or IFMP (DFO
2018b). Key management objectives such as total allowable catch (TAC), spawning escapement targets
(SET), management adjustments (MAs), low abundance exploitation rates (LAERs), and aboriginal
fisheries exemptions (AFEs) are all directly influenced by the size of aggregate returns for each
management group. In addition, the PSC utilizes both the run size forecasts and associated management
inputs to evaluate the sensitivity of fishing plans and the probability of achieving management
objectives across a range of run size scenarios using a fisheries simulation model. Prior to the availability

9

Pre-season planning: pre-season management information

of in-season data which are used to refine estimates of run size and timing, early management decisions
rely on the results of the pre-season simulations to evaluate catch proposals made by each country.
Finally, while the Fraser River Panel typically adopts updated run sizes based on in-season stock
assessments, the stock-specific forecasts and the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the probability
distributions provided by DFO pre-season continue to be used as priors in Bayesian run size
assessments.

Data
Detailed descriptions of the data used to forecast Fraser River sockeye salmon run size can be found in
Grant et al. (2010) and Cass et al. (2006). Time series of stock recruit data are currently available for 20
of the 27 forecasted stocks. The majority rely on spawning escapement and estimates of returns by age,
while some also have historical time series of juvenile abundance in terms of fry or smolts (Grant et al.
2010, Table 1). Spawning escapement is usually quantified as the number of females contributing to the
spawning population based on potential egg deposition (i.e., effective females spawners (EFS), Cass et
al. 2006). The one exception is the Cultus Lake population where estimates of EFS are poorly
determined; therefore, total adult escapement data are used instead (Cass et al. 2006). Stocks identified
in the forecast as miscellaneous rely solely on historical timeseries of escapement data to generate the
forecast given their lack of sufficient recruitment information (Table 1).

Most Fraser sockeye stocks are comprised of four year old salmon that entered the ocean at age 2 (42
sockeye) and five year old salmon that have spent an additional year in the ocean (52). The total
forecasted recruitment in a given year is therefore based on the sum of the estimated number of 4 and
5-year-old recruits from different brood years. For Fraser River sockeye salmon, only the Harrison stock
has a different age structure as they enter the ocean as one-year old smolts and the resulting
recruitment forecast is comprised of forecasted estimates of 3 and 4-year-old salmon (31 and 41
sockeye).

In addition to biological data, environmental covariates are used to improve the fit of traditional stock-
recruit models. These variables include mean winter (November-March) indices from the Pacific Decadal
Oscillation (PDO), mean spring-summer (April-July) sea surface temperatures collected at Entrance or
Pine Island, and Fraser River peak and mean discharge from April to June measured in Hope (Grant et al.
2010).

Methods
A wide range of different models are considered for the forecast (Tab) of Fraser River sockeye salmon
run size. Detailed descriptions and model structures of the pre-season run size forecast models can be
found in MacDonald and Grant (2012), Grant et al. (2010) and Cass et al. (2006). The complexity of the
forecast models is dependent on data available for each stock. Non-biological models, which are also
termed naïve models as they assume no underlying biological mechanism, calculate return forecasts
based on historical estimates of returns or returns per effective female spawner or per juvenile
(MacDonald and Grant 2012). These models rely on historical years or a subset of years or, in case data
for a stock are missing (e.g., miscellaneous stocks), on historical data from other stocks are used as
proxy (DFO 2018a).

Biological models are used when sufficient stock-specific spawner-recruitment data are available.
Biological models are based on a relationship between spawning escapement or juvenile abundance and
subsequent recruitment and include: 1) Ricker models (Ricker 1954); 2) power models; 3) Larkin models;
4) Kalman filter models; and 4) sibling models (MacDonald and Grant 2012). The Kalman filter models
account for changes in productivity over time while the sibling models rely on the return of a younger

10

Pre-season planning: pre-season management information

age class one year prior to predict returns of the older age class to account for shared productivity
between siblings. The various biological models may also include environmental variables as covariates,
which are especially of use when recruits encountered extreme environmental conditions during earlier
parts of their life history. Uncertainty in parameter estimates and the resulting return size forecasts are
quantified by estimating Bayesian posterior probability distributions using Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) simulations run through WinBUGS software (DFO 2015).

Both non-biological and biological models produce estimates of the total number of recruits,
irrespective of the age and year in which they return to the Fraser River for spawning. To determine the
total number of returning sockeye salmon in a given year, the recruitment forecasts need to be split up
by age using age proportion estimates based on historical data. Age-specific recruitment is calculated by
multiplying the total return forecast by historical age proportions (Appendix 3 in Grant et al. 2010,
MacDonald and Grant 2012). In years of high expected proportions of age-five fish (or age-four fish for
the Harrison stock), sibling models are used to forecast returns of the older age group based on the
productivity calculated for their younger siblings that returned the previous year.

The selection of the model used to forecast a stock is based on a retrospective evaluation of the
performance of the different models and subsequent model ranking based on various performance
criteria. A jack-knife cross validation analysis is used to simulate forecasted time series of each stock and
model based on historical data. In the jack-knife analysis, data are sequentially removed for the single
year being forecast and the remaining stock-recruitment data are used to fit the model and generate a
forecasted run size (MacDonald and Grant 2012). For each model, the resulting time series of forecasted
run sizes are compared against historical observations through the calculation of a suite of model
performance measures: 1) mean raw error (MRE), 2) mean absolute error (MAE), 3) mean proportional
error (MPE), and 4) root mean square error (RMSE; Grant et al. 2010). For each stock, the relative
performance across models is calculated by applying a rank (from best to worst) for each metric (Grant
et al. 2010), and then averaging the ranks of individual model ranks across the performance metrics to
generate a single performance index for each model (MacDonald and Grant 2012). In addition to the
quantitative selection process, the forecast methodology also relies on a set of additional model
selection criteria (MacDonald and Grant 2012, Hawkshaw et al. 2020). The results of the top ranked
models are presented to a group of technical experts, who will review the model results for the
individual stocks as well as the model selection criteria across stocks. These expert driven model
selection criteria are adjusted annually as needed and reported in the forecast document (Hawkshaw et
al. 2020).

Results
Uncertainty in the forecast results is expressed in terms of a probability distribution which is described
in the forecast document (i.e., DFO 2019) in terms the following percentiles: 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and
90%. The median forecast (50th percentile, or p50) represents an equal chance (i.e., a one in two chance)
that the return will fall above or below the forecast value for each stock (Grant et al. 2010, DFO 2018a;
Table 3). In comparison, there is a one in four chance that the actual number of returning sockeye
salmon will fall at or below the forecast associated with the 25th percentile (p25 probability level).
Within the current forecast methodology, the p50 forecast assumes long term average productivity will
be maintained, the p10 and p25 forecasts assume below average productivity, while the p75 and p90
forecasts assume above average productivity (Grant et al. 2010).

Table 3 list the various forecasted stocks, the model used to generate that forecast, and percentiles that
define the forecast. For example, the Weaver stock (Table 3) in the Late run management group was
forecasted using a Ricker model with the PDO as an environmental covariate. At the 10% (p10)

11

Pre-season planning: pre-season management information

probability level, there is a one in ten chance that the actual return will fall at or below 38,000 fish, while
at the 90% (p90) probability level, there is a one in ten chance the actual return will be above 655,000.

Planned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement
As additional years of stock-recruit data become available, the performance of the pre-season run size
models are subject to change. Sockeye returns in recent years have been well below the median
forecast, which has resulted in overly optimistic pre-season plans and which points to a need to re-
evaluate model performance and/or adjust expectations for pre-season planning (DFO 2019). The
positive bias in recent run size forecasts could be a result of many different factors, but DFO
recommends a re-evaluation of the model performance given the lower than average productivity
observed across most stocks in recent years (DFO 2019). The ability to relate changes in marine survival
to environmental indices could also help improve forecasts (DFO 2019). A CSAS review of the forecast
methodology has been planned for the near future.

In addition, advances in DNA technology, in combination with increased abundance of some stocks, has
allowed the number of stocks for which spawner-recruitment are available to increase (e.g. Chilliwack).
These advances allow for additional forecasting methods be used for these stocks, potentially lowering
uncertainty associated with the forecast.

Finally, there has been some criticism of the simplified approach of summing total returns across
individual forecasts by summing the probability levels. For example, the p25 forecast for all Fraser River
sockeye stocks combined is currently based on the sum of the p25 forecast of the individual stocks.  This
approach assumes that stocks will all return at the same probability level (i.e., variation over time is fully
correlated). A more statistically valid approach would be to incorporate the observed correlation in run
size estimates between the component stocks (DFO 2019).

A2. Timing and Diversion Rate Forecasts

J.A. Gill, M.J. Hague and A. Phung

Summary
Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) provides the Pacific Salmon Commission with annual
forecasts of the migration timing, and migration route around Vancouver Island in accordance
with the Pacific Salmon Treaty. These forecasts are based on a series of different statistical
models that include various environmental covariates. These models are evaluated
retrospectively to assess the bias and precision of the forecast. The results of the top
performing models are reduced to single forecasts by bootstrap sampling from the probability
distributions of the different model forecasts. The uncertainty around the forecast is presented
by reporting the 95% probability interval in addition to the median. The resulting preseason
forecasts of timing and migration routes are important for pre-season expectations of
abundance and planning of fisheries (Chapter A6) and serve as informative prior probability
distribution inputs into the in-season stock assessment models (Chapter B19). DFO provides
timing forecasts for Early Stuart and Chilko stocks, while diversion rates are produced for the
aggregate Fraser River sockeye run. Work to increase the stock resolution of the timing and
diversion rate forecasts is ongoing.

Introduction
Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) produces annual forecasts of the marine migration timing and
migration route around Vancouver Island as part of their obligations under the Pacific Salmon Treaty
(PSC 2019, Chapter 4, Folkes et al. 2018). Marine timing for Fraser River sockeye is defined as the date
when 50% of a stock has passed through the marine areas on route to their natal freshwater stream for
spawning (Folkes et al. 2017, Figure 1). It is common to use the DFO statistical area 20 (Area 20) in Juan
de Fuca Strait as the reference location for the marine timing (Chapter B18). The Area 20 timing then
refers to the date when 50% of a stock has passed Area 20 assuming the entire run migrated through
Juan de Fuca Strait. The use of the Area 20 as a refence point for timing is largely due to the fact that
IPFSC historically used catch data collected from the southern migration route to derive marine
migration timing (Folkes et al. 2018). DFO only produces timing forecasts for the Early Stuart and Chilko
stocks. PSC staff uses the correlations between timing estimates or the timing offsets between stocks to
derive timing forecast of the other Fraser River sockeye stocks. The diversion rate refers the route an
individual salmon might take to return to the Fraser River to spawn (Folkes et al. 2018). More
specifically, the (northern) diversion rate indicates the proportion of the salmon that migrates through
Johnstone Strait (northern approach) as opposed to Juan de Fuca Strait (southern approach, Figure 2).
Estimates may reflect the diversion over a week or a few days or across the entire migration season.
Diversion rates have traditionally been derived for the total Fraser River sockeye aggregate but could
also be derived for individual stocks or management groups. The forecasts of timing and diversion rate
can be combined with the pre-season run size forecasts and historical estimates of the length of the
returning run (spread) to derive forecasts of daily abundances migrating through Juan de Fuca and
Johnstone Strait.

Data
Annual estimates of marine migration timing for Early Stuart and Chilko are derived from post-season
daily reconstruction abundances estimates (Chapter B18) based on daily hydroacoustic estimates
obtained at Mission (Chapter B10) plus seaward catches. The timing is defined as the date when the
cumulative abundance of these stock exceeds 50% of the total run size.  Annual post-season estimates
of northern diversion rate of the aggregate Fraser River sockeye population are estimated by dividing
the total abundance migrating through the northern (Johnstone Strait) approach by the total
abundance. (Folkes et al. 2018). Prior to 1995, estimates of diversion rate were based on commercial
fishery catches along both migration routes (Folkes et al. 2018). Commercial catches of Fraser River
sockeye started declining after 1995. Therefore, recent estimates of diversion are based on catch per
unit effort (CPUE) data from test fisheries operating in Juan de Fuca and Johnstone Straits (Putman et al.
2014).

In addition to relying on historical estimates of migration timing and diversion rate, the methods to
forecast these estimates also rely on environmental data that are assumed to impact timing and
diversion. The full suite of environmental data used in Folkes et al. (2018) include three El Niño indices
(Oceanic Niño Index (ONI), Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), and the Bivariate ENSO Timeseries (BEST)),
Fraser River discharge, relative sea level, sea surface temperature (in the open ocean and near-shore),
sea surface salinity, wind stress, ocean current velocity (from both the NEPSTAR (North East Pacific
Salmon Tracking and Research) ocean model and the OSCAR (Ocean Surface Current Analysis Real-time)
data series), and earth magnetic field estimates (intensity and inclination, Table 1).

Methods
A set of different models are used to produce the timing and diversion rate forecast (Table 2). These
models range from naïve models that rely on historical data to linear regression models, generalized
additive models (GAM) and shape constrained additive models (SCAM) that include environmental
covariates (Table 1) at different levels of resolution (Folkes et al. 2017, Folkes et al. 2018). Using jack-
knife and retrospective analyses, models are ranked annually against five performance measures to
determine their ability to provide precise and unbiased predictions: mean raw error, absolute mean raw
error, absolute mean error, mean square error, root mean squared error. The models to derive the
forecasts are selected based on user tolerance of model uncertainty (Folkes et al. 2018). The results of
the various models are reduced to a single forecast by bootstrap sampling from the probability
distributions of the different model forecasts. The uncertainty around the forecast is presented by
reporting the 50% and 95% probability intervals in addition to the median.

Table 2. The statistical models used to forecast migration timing or diversion rate (from Folkes et
al. 2018).

Forecasts in each year are dependent on the performance of individual models and the available data.
From an assessment point of view, there are three time periods for which forecasts are required:
preliminary planning in February and April, updated planning in June and in-season assessments in July
and August. At the time of the preseason planning in February, the forecast of timing and diversion rates
are usually based on naïve models that account for differences between cycle line years. Models that
include environmental covariates are only used in June as environmental data collected closer to the
season has a better ability to predict timing and diversion. In-season these forecasts will be used as
informative prior probability distributions within the in-season stock assessment models.

DFO only produces timing estimates for Early Stuart and Chilko. PSC staff uses the correlations between
timing estimates or the timing offsets between stocks to produce timing forecast for the remainder of
the stock groups modelled preseason and in-season. The Retrospective Evaluation Framework (REF) tool
was created to standardize how decisions on pre-season migration timing are made. The REF tool allows
PSC staff to retrospectively evaluate methods to obtain migration timing estimates across different
stocks and cycle lines.

Results
Timing forecasts are provided by DFO for both Early Stuart and Chilko stocks. Table 3 is an example of
these forecasts for Chilko (Folkes et al. 2019a). The table lists the seven models that ranked highest in
terms of model performance: four were naïve models including two auto regressive integrated moving
average (ARIMA) models and three were multivariate models with environmental covariates. The
forecast models are described in terms of the year and month in which the environmental data was
collected that they rely on to produce the forecast, e.g. March [3] of the previous year [-1] or June [6] of
the current year [0]. For covariates that are model derived, the description will also include details of the
data used such as northward current velocity [v], eastward current velocity [u] and wind stress [n]. The
last row of the table contains the bootstrapping results that combines the forecasts from the different
models. The forecast is presented in terms of the median and the 50 and 95% probability intervals (PI).
In this example the median timing forecast for Chilko is August 10 and the 95% probability interval
ranges from August 1 to August 19, meaning that there is a 5% chance the actual migration timing will
fall outside this range. The table to describe the diversion rate forecast (Table 4) is similar to the timing
forecast. In this case, one naïve model and six multivariate models were used to produce the forecast
(Folkes et al. 2019b). When converting the annual Fraser River sockeye diversion rate forecast into daily
estimates, it is important to take into account the general trend towards increased northern diversion as
the season progresses (Figure 3).

Planned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement
Daily reconstructed abundance estimates are used to derive migration timing and diversion rate
estimates. Historical reconstruction files however vary in stock-resolution, file structure, and data
assumptions, leading to inconsistencies in stock specific timing and diversion rate estimates across
years. Therefore, the historical reconstruction file system will be reworked with the aim to standardize
file assumptions, increase the stock and spatial resolution of reconstructed abundances, and populate a
run reconstruction database. Upon completion, it will be possible to query the resulting database to
obtain improved yearly timing estimates at varying stock resolution as well as obtain annual and in-
season diversion rate estimates at different stock resolution. The newly developed REF tool
(Retrospective Evaluation Framework) will be used to analyze, validate and document differences in
historical versus updated timing and diversion rate estimates.

A3. Fraser River Sockeye Management Adjustments

M.R. Forrest and M.J. Hague

Summary
The Management Adjustment (MA) refers to the additional fish added to an escapement target
to increase the likelihood of achieving that target and takes into account en route loss and
other factors that cause differences between predicted and observed escapement estimates
(DBEs, differences between estimates). Early pre-season planning relies on historic DBE data to
forecast DBEs while immediately prior to the season in June, statistical models are used to
predict DBEs. For Early Stuart, Early Summer and Summer-run sockeye, statistical models use
forecasted Fraser River temperature at Qualark, B.C. and Fraser River discharge at Hope, B.C. fit
to a historical timeseries of escapement discrepancies to generate pre-season DBE predictions.
For Late-run the statistical model is fit to upstream timing (the 50% date at Mission) to
generate the pre-season predictions of DBEs. Despite the associated uncertainty, preseason
DBE forecasts provide managers with an early indication of the expected discrepancy between
the potential spawning escapement (PSE) and the spawning escapement (SE). This facilitates a
more informed decision-making process and allows the Fraser Panel to be proactive in adopting
MA estimates in response to adverse environmental conditions and adjust the fishing pressure
to increase the probability of achieving spawning escapement targets.

Introduction
Under the Pacific Salmon Treaty, the Fraser River Panel has the discretion to add additional fish to the
spawning escapement target (SET) set by Canada for Fraser River sockeye salmon (O. nerka) to ensure
spawning requirements are met (PST, Article IV, Chapter 4, Paragraph 3b). The additional fish added to
the escapement targets for the different management units of Fraser River sockeye are termed the
Management Adjustments (MAs) and they are used for the purpose of increasing the likelihood of
achieving the SET. The idea is that extra fish are allowed to escape upriver of Mission to account for
anticipated negative differences between in-season versus post-season estimates of spawning
escapement caused by en route mortality due to poor environmental conditions during upstream
migration, such as high discharge levels and warmer water temperatures. The differences between in-
season and post-season estimates can however also stem from biases in the in-season and post-season
assessments and the resulting catch and spawner estimates. In this case, the resulting bias can both be
positive or negative.

For pre-season planning, it is important to make accurate assumptions about the Management
Adjustment to ensure the SETs are met. Practically, this means managers must predict the likely
difference between estimates (DBE). Depending on the available data, either historical data or statistical
models are used to predict DBEs. Prior to June, managers use median values from the historical dataset
for each management group. In June, when long-range forecasts of temperature and discharge are
available, the DBEs are predicted using statistical models that relate historical DBEs to environmental
river conditions. These models are similar to the in-season DBE models that rely on shorter range
temperature and discharge forecasts. Historically, when discharge levels or temperatures are above
average, DBEs also tend to be high. In addition, for Early Stuart and Early Summer runs, in-season
estimates are consistently higher than spawning ground estimates even when migration conditions are
within normal ranges, and this tendency is also captured by the DBE models. For Late-run sockeye,

24

Pre-season planning: pre-season management information

historical DBEs are related to the date when half the run has migrated past Mission (i.e., Mission 50%
date), which captures the negative impact of the early migration behaviour observed since the mid-
1990s on the migration success of these stocks (Lapointe et al. 2003, Cooke et al. 2004).

Data
The in-season and post-season spawning escapement estimates, the 50% migration dates at Hells Gate
and Mission and the temperature and discharge at Hells Gate are the primary biological data used to
predict DBEs. These are used as inputs in the statistical models (Chapter B24). Hells Gate is used as the
geographic reference point to describe Fraser River environmental conditions because it is a well-known
impediment to successful upstream salmon migration.

The DBE data are derived from the historical differences between in-season projections of spawning
escapement (i.e., Mission escapement minus catch above Mission, or “potential spawning escapement,
PSE”) and post-season estimates (i.e., spawning ground estimates, “spawning escapement, SE”).

The 50% Hells Gate date for Early Stuart, Early Summer and Summer run are used to determine the
mean temperature and discharge experienced by the management group across 31 days. The 50% date
at Mission for Late run is used in the DBE run timing model (Chapter B25). The 50% migration date at
Hells Gate or Mission for the different management groups is the date at which 50% of that group has
passed these locations in the Fraser River. The Hells Gate and Mission dates are derived from marine
migration timing estimates in statistical Area 20, Juan de Fuca Strait (Chapter A2). The travel time from
Area 20 to Mission is assumed to be 6 days for Early Stuart, Early Summer and Summer run sockeye. The
Late run sockeye travel time to Mission depends on their delay before up-stream migration but is
assumed to be 8 days when travelling without delay. The travel time from Mission to Hells Gate is
assumed to be 5 days for the Early Stuart, Summer and Late run sockeye and only 4 days for the Early
Summer run sockeye.

Pre-season, the long-range forecasts for temperature and discharge are provided to PSC staff by
Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) Environmental Watch Program (Patterson et al. 2007, Chapter B23). In
combination with predicted migration timing forecast, the daily estimates of the long-range forecast
allow to create 31-day mean Fraser River temperature forecasts at Qualark, B.C. and 31-day mean Fraser
River discharge forecasts at Hope, B.C. (Morrison 2005, Morrison et al. 2005, Hague et al. 2014). These
long-range forecasts are provided by the DFO Environmental Watch Program in June in the form of
10,000 paired predictions of Fraser River discharge and temperature that capture the uncertainty
associated with these forecasts. In addition to the long-range forecast, the pre-season DBE models also
use historical Fraser River temperature and discharge estimates. The DFO Environmental Watch group
maintains a database of these data and an updated copy of historical observed Fraser River temperature
at Qualark and discharge at Hope are provided to the PSC annually.

PREDICTIONS USING MEDIAN VALUES

Pre-season planning begins in early February. At this time, reliable long-range environmental forecasts
are not yet available and early pre-season MAs are therefore based on median values of historical
datasets. Median values are calculated by using the time series of ln(PSE/SE) data. This median is then
converted to a pMA (proportional MA) using the following equation:

(1)

𝑝𝑀𝐴 =   [𝑒𝑥𝑝 (

𝑃𝑆𝐸

𝑆𝐸

) − 1]

25

Pre-season planning: pre-season management information

The pMA is converted to the official pDBE (proportional DBE, rounded to two decimal places) using the
following equation:

(2)

𝑝𝐷𝐵𝐸 =   [

1
(1+𝑝𝑀𝐴)

  − 1]

For some management groups, like Early Stuart and Summer run, there have been no substantial
differences detected between the pDBEs of different cycle lines. Therefore, the median pDBE has been
based on all historical years. The pDBEs for Early Summer-run and Late-run groups often vary depending
on the cycle line. For example, in Dominant or Subdominant Early South Thompson years, pDBEs may
differ substantially from the pDBEs on off-cycle years, indicating that the response of this group to
negative environmental conditions differs depending on their abundance. Therefore, the Early Summer-
run dataset might be reduced to only Dominant or Dominant and Subdominant years when calculating
the median pDBE for those years. Similarly, the datasets can also be reduced to odd pink years or cycle
line years if pDBEs on those years differ from other years. However, this significantly reduces the
number of data points used to calculate the median.

MODEL PREDICTIONS USING LONG TERM ENVIRONMENTAL FORECASTS

In June, pDBE predictions are based on statistical DBE models using long-range forecasts of river
conditions in combination with in-river migration timing predictions to produce current year forecasts.
For Early Stuart, Early Summer and Summer-run sockeye, these models are regression models relating
freshwater conditions defined by temperature (T) and discharge (Q) to differences between estimates
(MacDonald et al. 2010). The forecasted 31-day mean T and Q centered around the 50% date at Hells
Gate is used as a model input to forecast the DBE for the current year. These DBE timing and discharge
models are run separately for each management group and are based on each group’s 50% date at
Hell’s Gate. The 31-day model captures 90% or more of a run’s exposure to environmental conditions at
Hell’s Gate and provides a better fit to the historical DBE data than environmental data averaged over a
shorter time-period (Hague et al. 2007).

For Late-run sockeye the statistical model is a regression model that relates early upstream migration to
differences between estimates. The DBE run-timing model prediction is based on a pre-season
prediction of upstream timing, which is dependent on the number of days the salmon delay in the Strait
of Georgia. The estimate of delay is based on historical delay patterns for the different cycle lines. Due
to the uncertainty in the upstream timing estimate, the Panel is often presented with a range of DBE
predictions using multiple upstream timing dates before and after the current estimate. In recent years,
the Panel has agreed to use the adopted pre-season median unless in-season timing is later than a
specific date. The date is determined by the date at which the DBE prediction from the run-timing model
using all years is lower than the adopted median DBE.

Results
In February, management considerations for the upcoming season are presented to the Panel. The
preliminary pDBE estimates for consideration by the Fraser River Panel at this time are based on the
median pDBEs. These very preliminary pDBEs are used by PSC staff to seed the planning model and by
DFO in the preliminary escapement plan. In April the preliminary pDBEs are reviewed again with
possible changes depending on updated information and Fraser River Panel guidance. The resulting
pMAs are then used for all of the April planning model work. In June, the DFO Environmental Watch
group provides the pre-season long-range forecasts of temperature and discharge and PSC staff use the
environmental models to forecast the pDBE for Early Stuart, Early Summer run and Summer run
sockeye.  The Panel may choose to adopt (if either party accepts) or not adopt (if both parties reject) the

26

Pre-season planning: pre-season management information

recommended pDBEs or may choose a different value as they see fit (by bilateral agreement). The
adopted pMA is then used in the pre-season planning model for in-season fisheries management until
the Panel adopts an in-season pMA.

Planned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement
There is quite a lot of uncertainty associated with the pDBE forecast estimates as well as the long-range
preseason temperature and discharge forecast estimates used as inputs into the model. This has caused
some reluctance from the part of the Fraser River Panel to adopt preseason DBEs based long-range
environmental forecasts. Instead the Panel has often preferred to rely on historical data when
preseason planning.

The current T & Q models predict a DBE for each management group but do not incorporate group
specific information despite known differences in tolerances to adverse migration conditions (Eliason et
al. 2011).

MAs are only of relevance if there is a potential for a harvestable surplus. In years when preseason run
size estimates are too low for a harvestable surplus, management adjustments have no management
consequences and are therefore not adopted by the Fraser River Panel.

A4. Pre-season Fraser River Sockeye Spawning
Escapement Plan

C.G.J. Michielsens

Summary
Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) provides pre-season escapement plans to the Pacific
Salmon Commission (PSC) as part of their obligations under the Pacific Salmon Treaty (Chapter
4, Paragraph 4). Long-term escapement strategies for Fraser River sockeye stocks are derived
through the FRSSI (Fraser River Sockeye Spawning Initiative) process and vetted through
domestic consultation. The simulation model used as part of the process evaluates the
performance of different control rules and assesses their robustness to different sources of
uncertainty such as assumptions about population dynamics and future patterns of
productivity. The resulting escapement plan is defined in terms of a TAM (Total Allowable
Mortality) rule that accounts for both fishing and natural mortality due to adverse
environmental conditions en route to the spawning grounds. The TAM rules for the different
management groups are defined by Lower and Upper Fishery Reference Points, TAM caps and
Low Abundance Exploitation rates (LAERs). The use of TAM rules as part of the escapement
plan results in dynamic escapement goals that are updated repeatedly in-season based on
updated information on run size and adopted Management Adjustments (MAs). The resulting
TAC (Total Allowable Catch) is calculated as the aggregated Fraser River sockeye abundance
available after the escapement target, the Management Adjustment, the agreed Fraser River
Aboriginal Exemption and the expected catch in Panel-authorized test fisheries are deducted
from the pre-season run size forecasts.

Introduction
As part of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) obligations under the Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST 2020,
Chapter 4), escapement targets are provided to the Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) prior to the fishing
season. These spawning escapement targets are defined through an escapement plan that takes into
account the run size as well as adverse environmental conditions that could reduce the probability of
reaching those targets. The latter is achieved by increasing the escapement by adding fish to the target
in the form of a Management Adjustment (MA, MacDonald et al. 2010). The escapement plan has been
derived though the Fraser River Sockeye Spawning Initiative (FRSSI), a multi-year collaborative planning
process by DFO to develop a long-term escapement strategy (Pestal et al. 2008). The simulation model
that is part of the FRSSI process allows for the evaluation of the performance of different escapement
strategies through the application of different harvest control rules. In addition, it explores the
robustness of these strategies to different key sources of uncertainty such as possible alternative
population dynamics and future patterns of productivity. The use of a harvest control rule as part of the
escapement plan result in dynamic escapement goals that are updated repeatedly during the fishing
season from updated information on run size and in-season environmental conditions (Pestal et al.
2012).

29

Pre-season planning: pre-season management information

Data
The simulation model used within the FRSSI process is populated using the stock-recruitment data for 19
distinct Fraser River sockeye stocks that, on average, make up 98.6% of the total sockeye run for the
Fraser River (Pestal et al. 2007). These data are also used for the forecast and are described in detail in
Grant et al. (2010). The majority of the stocks rely on spawning escapement and estimates of returns by
age, while some stocks also have historical time series of juvenile abundance in terms of fry or smolts
(Grant et al. 2010).

Methods
The simulation model developed as part of the FRSSI process aims to evaluate the long-term
performance of different harvest control rules under a wide range of alternative biological assumptions
and hypothesized future states of nature (Chaput et al. 2013). The model includes 19 different stocks,
grouped into 4 management units (Early Stuart, Early Summer run, Summer run and Late run). The
abundance of the stocks is simulated into the future based on historical stock-recruitment relationships.
The simulation models differ depending on the assumptions they make on the population dynamics of
the stocks, which includes different assumptions about stock-recruit relationships and interactions
between cycle lines, different future trends in productivity and natural mortality. Within the simulations,
the different population dynamic scenarios are used to evaluate specific escapement strategies for the
different management groups based on a control rule. The outputs from the model simulations are used
to track the status of each individual stock.

For Fraser River sockeye salmon, the ability to reach escapement goals is not only impacted by fisheries
but also by mortality caused by adverse environmental conditions. The control rule for Fraser River
sockeye is therefore formulated in terms of a TAM (Total Allowable Mortality) rule (Figure 1) and
accounts both for fishing and natural mortality. The TAM rule is defined by a Lower Fishery Reference
Point, an Upper Fishery Reference Point, a TAM cap and a Low Abundance Exploitation rate (LAER).
When the in-season run size is below the Lower Fishery Reference Point, no directed ﬁsheries are
allowed; only incidental harvest, directed at co-migrating stocks, is permitted. This incidental harvest
needs to remain well below the Low Abundance Exploitation rate. In case the in-season run-size
estimate is above the Upper Fishery Reference Point, the Total Allowable Mortality (TAM) rate remains
ﬁxed at the TAM cap. The projected MA is subtracted from the TAM to calculate the final allowable ER
calculation (DFO 2018). Between the Lower and Upper Fishery Reference Points, a ﬁxed escapement
target, equal to the Lower Fishery Reference Point, is assumed. The different components of the TAM
rule are derived through the simulation modelling and the FRSSI process and vetted through domestic
consultation (Chaput et al. 2013). The pre-season TAC (Total Allowable Catch) is derived using the TAM
rule and calculated as the aggregated Fraser River sockeye abundance available after the escapement
target, the management adjustment, the agreed Fraser River Aboriginal Exemption and the expected
catch in Panel-authorized test fishing catch are deducted from the pre-season run size forecast.

Figure 1. Graphical presentation of the Total Allowable Mortality rule for Fraser River sockeye
salmon (DFO 2018). The Lower Fishery Reference Point is here represented as the No-Fishing
Point while the Upper Reference Point is represented as the Cut-back Point.  The Low Abundance
Exploitation Rate (LAER) is applied after the TAM rule and is not shown in the figure.

Results
The FRSSI process results in the creation of a pre-season spawning escapement plan (Table 1). The top
table of Table 1 describes the TAM rule: the low abundance exploitation rate (LAER), the TAM Cap, the
Lower and the upper Fishery Reference Points and the pre-season pMA at the p50 level Fraser River
sockeye forecast. The subsequent tables illustrate the application of the TAM rule for different run size
forecast levels for each of the four management groups. More specifically, at the different forecast
levels, the table will provide the % TAM implied by the forecast level (TAM rule (%)), the number of fish
added to the escapement target based on the assumed pMA (Escapement Target MA), the sum of the
escapement target and the MA, the low abundance exploitation rate, and the available exploitation rate
given the run size, escapement target and MA. If the run size is smaller than the escapement target plus
MA, the available exploitation rate is 0%. If the available exploitation rate exceeds the LAER, the
allowable exploitation rate will equal the available rate. If the available exploitation rate is lower than
the LAER, the allowable exploitation rate will equal the LAER but it should be emphasized that a LAER is
not a target but allows for by-catch of a management group in fisheries directed at other management

31

Pre-season planning: pre-season management information

groups or species with available surpluses. Table 1 also translates the allowable exploitation rate into
the number of sockeye available to be harvested. In order to translate this into a TAC (Total allowable
catch) for the aggregate management groups, the Aboriginal Fisheries Exemption (AFE) and test fishing
catches need to be removed. Subsequent information in the table illustrates the performance of the
TAM rule in terms of the resulting escapement when perfectly executed and assuming the pre-season
MA forecast is correct. More specifically, it calculates the number of spawners that are predicted to
reach the spawning grounds while taking into account en route loss and compares these numbers
against the numbers observed in the brood year (BY spawners) and on average on the cycle, both in
absolute numbers as well as in percentage.

Planned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement
The impact of changes in productivity have been quantitatively included in the simulation model
scenarios to derive the TAM rules. Due to concerns about the potential impacts of increased variability
and observed trends in productivity that accompanies climate change, DFO is currently reviewing the
robustness of the current and alternative harvest control rules. This is occurring within the FRSSI model
by testing the TAM rules against alternative future productivity patterns to identify TAM rules that
produce undesirable outcomes. DFO is targeting the incorporation of productivity changes in the
evaluation of the harvest control rules in time for the 2022 Fraser River sockeye season.

Even though the simulation model used to derive escapement plans evaluates the impact of different
TAM rules on individual stocks, the in-season implementation aims to ensure escapement targets are
reached for each management group, not for each stock. Currently the Committee on the Status of
Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) has assessed 8 stocks as endangered (Early Stuart, Bowron,
Taseko, Late Stuart, Quesnel, Portage, Weaver, Cultus) and 2 as threatened (North Barriere, Widgeon,
(COSEWIC 2017).

A5. Test Fishing Catch Forecasts

E. Taylor

Test fishing plans are developed pre-season by the Fraser River Panel with the objective to
inform decisions of the Panel while minimizing negative implications for conservation and for
other fisheries, i.e., minimizing the number of fish retained. Because test fishing catch are
accounted for prior to allocating Total Allowable Catch (TAC, Chapter B26), they have a direct
impact on potential harvest opportunities. Pre-season forecasts of test fishing catches are
therefore important for planning and as inputs into the Fishery Planning Model (FPM, Chapter
A6). They are also important to determine the financial outlook of test fishing operations. While
test fishing catches are not limited to Fraser River sockeye salmon, the test fishing deduction to
the TAC is an estimate of the total retained Fraser River sockeye catch from all Panel-approved
test fisheries. This deduction is made up of two components: fish that are unavoidably killed
when conducting test fishing operations or the fish required for biological samples (non-
discretionary catch) and additional fish retained by the test fishery to offset test fishing costs
(discretionary catch, also referred to as pay fish). Forecast of non-discretionary catches are
based on test fishing catches on previous cycle line years, adjusted to account for differences in
run size while discretionary catch forecasts are dependent on assumed average weight and
price. Pay fish however are only retained when agreed to by the Fraser River Panel and
following specific conditions as set out by the PSC Test Fishing Policy (2021).

Introduction
The Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC), or its predecessor the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries
Commission, has operated test fisheries to obtain data required to inform bilateral decisions of the
Fraser River Panel since the 1960s. These test fisheries implemented under the Pacific Salmon Treaty are
essential for the Fraser River Panel to fulfil its responsibilities in terms of ensuring conservation
objectives are met through appropriate in-season harvest management and catch allocation. Test fishing
catch refers to the number of salmon caught and retained in Panel-approved test fisheries. The test
fishing catch is comprised of non-discretionary and discretionary catch. Non-discretionary catch refers to
the fish that are unavoidably killed when conducting test fishing operations. This catch includes all
salmon caught by gill nets and those required for biological samples. Discretionary catches refer to the
retention of additional salmon by the marine purse seine or reef net test fisheries to offset the costs of
the test fishing program. Discretionary catch is often referred to as Pay Fish. Guidelines for the retention
of test fishing catches and pay fish are described in the PSC Test Fishing Policy (2021).

Predicting test fishing catches is an important component of the pre-season planning process as reliable
predictions of test fishing catches and associated revenue are important to plan for potential financial
surplus or deficit scenarios. In addition, test fishing catch forecasts are also important to predict Total
Allowable Catch (TAC) which is derived by deducting the agreed Fraser River Aboriginal Exemption and
the predicted catch in Panel-authorized test fisheries from the harvestable surplus (Chapter A4). Test
fishing catches are therefore also termed test fishing deductions when discussing TAC calculations
(Chapter B26). Test fishing catch forecasts are generated several years ahead based on past catches on
the same cycle years and are updated annually based on preseason run size estimates, generated before
the start of the fishing season. In-season, these forecasts are replaced with actual catch observations.

36

Pre-season planning: pre-season management information

Data
Predictions of non-discretionary test fishing catches are based on historical catch data of all test fisheries
combined, while weight and price information are used to predict the catch needed to cover the cost of
the test fishing program.

Methods
For non-discretionary catch, a multi-year retrospective analysis indicated that there is a strong
correlation between the non-discretionary catch and historical catches over the previous three cycle
years. Preseason, prior to a preseason run size forecast being available, the average of the three cycle
years are used to forecast test fishing catches. Once a run size forecast is available, this estimate is used
to scale the test fishing catches of the historical years by dividing the total test fishing catches by the
total run sizes and calculating the non-discretionary test fishing harvest rates. These historical harvest
rates, used in combination with the run size forecast, allow to predict non-discretionary test fishing
catches.

When discretionary catch is authorized, it is normally with the intention of achieving cost-neutrality and
therefore discretionary catch predictions are based on the number of salmon needed to pay for the test
fishing program minus non-discretionary catches. The forecast of the discretionary catch is dependant
on the assumed average weight and price of the salmon. Under certain conditions, additional
discretionary salmon could be caught beyond the salmon needed to pay for the test fishing program in
the current year with the aim to supplement the test fishing revolving fund and offset future test fishing
costs. These conditions include extremely high salmon abundances and/or the ability of either country
to harvest their full TAC (PSC 2021).

When test fishing catch forecasts are used as deductions in the TAC calculations, they need to be
allocated to individual management groups, i.e., Early Stuart, Early Summer, Summer and Late run. For
non-discretionary catches, this is achieved by multiplying the total catch forecast with the average
proportion by management group as observed on the three most recent cycle years. For discretionary
catches, the management group-specific estimates are obtained by multiplying the total discretionary
catch estimates with the proportions of each management group within the predicted harvestable
surplus for the current year.

Planned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement
Overall, the use of 3-year cycle line averages to predict non-discretionary and discretionary catches has
been a simple and effective method and there are no changes planned to the current estimation
methodology. As run sizes have declined in recent years, there has been increased attention paid to the
test fishing catches as a deduction to the harvestable surplus as it determines the available TAC to be
shared by Canada and the U.S. In some years, when the distribution of test fishing catch across
management groups has differed substantially from the distribution based on the run size forecast, the
method has been adjusted slightly to only rely on past years with similar distributions across
management groups.

Pre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans

A6. Planning Model – General Overview

M.J. Hague

Summary
Pre-season, the Fraser River Panel uses a fisheries simulation model developed by PSC staff,
hereafter referred to as the PSC Planning Model, to develop preliminary fishing plans, to
identify potential limitations in achieving management objectives, and to explore the effect of
uncertain biological and management inputs on proposed fisheries. The goal of these plans is to
create a fisheries schedule which meets Panel objectives under key pre-season assumptions.
The PSC Planning Model is a simulation tool primarily used to assess sensitivity of fisheries plans
and achievement of management targets under alternative biological (e.g. run size, diversion
rate) and/or management (e.g. total allowable mortality rules) scenarios. Model results are
used to guide pre-season planning for stakeholders and to inform early in-season management
decisions prior to the availability of updated in-season run size information (Chapter B19). This
report describes the general process used to populate, run and evaluate the PSC Planning
Model. Detailed descriptions of model inputs and the technical implementation of the model
structure are described in the companion Chapters A7-A9.

Introduction
Pursuant to Article IV, Chapter 4, Paragraph 9d, of the Pacific Salmon Treaty, the Fraser River Technical
Committee (FRTC) and Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) staff work jointly to develop fisheries and
management plans for Fraser River sockeye salmon prior to the start of each fishing season using the
PSC Planning Model. The goal of these plans is to create a provisional fisheries schedule which meets
Panel objectives (PST, Article IV, Chapter 4, paragraph 10) under key pre-season assumptions.
Historically, pre-season fishing plans for Fraser River sockeye salmon were based on management
experiences in previous years, but as the variability in biological forecasts and the complexity of the
management regimes increased, managers realised the need for a more rigorous and structured
planning tool (Cave and Gazey 1994). The first version of the PSC Planning Model was created by Rod
Cooke and Jim Cave (IPSFC, predecessor of the PSC) in 1984, and was used extensively beginning in 1985
(final year of the IPSFC) (J. Cave, personal communication). These models were developed in early
spreadsheet software and were restricted in size and complexity due to the computer processing
limitations of the day. Early run reconstruction models (Starr and Hilborn 1988) influenced later updates
to the Planning Model structure and harvest rate parameterisation (Cave and Gazey 1994) and the
model was re-coded in Excel in 1997 (J. Cave, personal communication).

Over time, the model has been adapted and updated to reflect changes to fishery structure and to
address requests from the FRP and FRTC. Some of these changes include controls for individual
transferable quota (ITQ) fisheries in Canada, separate accounting for Fisheries Induced Mortalities
(FIMs), tracking of both discretionary (i.e. pay fish) and non-discretionary test fishing catch, changes in
assignment of stocks to management groups, Management Adjustment (MA) deductions, inclusion of
Low Abundance Exploitation Rates (LAERs), changes to the relevance of different fisheries and
refinements to underlying biological assumptions. While the spreadsheet model continued to meet
most pre-season management objectives, the structural framework restricted flexibility and was prone
to errors during the revision process.

38

Pre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans

In 2011, the FRTC and FRP agreed to restructure the PSC Planning Model in R statistical software (R Core
Team 2013) which could handle the increased complexity required to explicitly model many of the
model assumptions. Over the next several years, PSC staff worked with Panel and Technical Committee
members to develop the current Planning Model which is controlled by a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
developed using the RShiny package (Shiny (rstudio.com)). The R model has improved the transparency
of underlying model assumptions and has increased the flexibility and ease with which the modellers
can make changes to fisheries and stock structure.

Data
The PSC Planning Model relies on three different types of data inputs: biological, fisheries, and
management. A more thorough description of the key inputs in the Planning Model is provided in
Chapter A7, but they are also briefly described here. The biological inputs define the abundance of the
expected salmon return, i.e. the run size forecast, and how these salmon are distributed in space and
time. The latter is defined by the timing of the run, the number of days it takes for 95% of the run to
migrate through an area (i.e., the spread), the proportion of the total run migrating through Johnstone
Strait (i.e. the diversion rate), the proportion of the run that delays their upstream migration into the
Fraser River and the number of days of delay. Within the Planning Model, stocks are grouped for
modelling purposes based on similarities in migratory patterns (12 modelling groups) but are aggregated
by management group (Early Stuart, Early Summer, Summer, Late-run, and Fraser pinks) for reporting
and evaluation purposes.

The fisheries inputs relate to the anticipated amount of fishing effort or resulting catch, how that effort
or catch will be distributed across the salmon season and if catches will be retained or released. In the
case of test fishing catches, fisheries input also includes predicted non-discretionary catches as well as
discretionary catches and the schedule when these discretionary catches will be taken to pay for the test
fishing program, i.e. taken as pay fish (Chapter A5).

The management inputs differ by management group and are defined by the various components of the
Spawning Escapement Plan (Chapter A4): the Spawning Escapement Target (SET), the Management
Adjustment (MA) (Chapter A3), the Test Fishing Deduction (Chapter A5), the Aboriginal Fisheries
Exemption (AFE) and the Low Abundance Exploitation Rate (LAER). In addition, the PSC Planning Model
also requires inputs regarding the allocation of the Total Allowable Catch (TAC, Chapter B26) across the
various fisheries, both internationally as well as nationally.

Model inputs are either based on medians derived from historical time series, generated by forecast
models run outside of the Planning Model structure, or based on the expert judgment from within the
FRTC and FRP. Because several forecast models to produce biological inputs require covariate data and
these are only available immediately prior to the season, Planning Model inputs in early spring rely
primarily on medians derived from historical time series (Chapter A7). Depending on the source of the
data, inputs are either updated annually, multiple times annually, or as additional information becomes
available. There are two key parameterisation timeframes: the first occurs in the early spring when most
inputs are typically calculated from historical timeseries, and the second occurs in late spring once more
covariates for forecast models become available. The updating of management and fisheries inputs
typically follows the same schedule as for the biological parameters of the model. February inputs are
based on historical observations, run size forecasts, and preliminary escapement plans and are typically
finalised during the June meeting once the Canadian Minister of Fisheries has approved Canada’s annual
Integrated Fisheries Management Plan (IFMP, DFO 2018).

Under the Pacific Salmon Treaty (Article IV, Chapter 4, Paragraphs 3 and 4), Canada is responsible for
producing run-size specific estimates of SETs, LAERs, and AFEs. In addition, the technical chairs provide

39

Pre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans

information relating to anticipated fishing effort levels, fishing schedules for their respective countries,
and domestic catch allocations for their respective countries. Secretariat staff provide advice on
preseason estimates of management adjustments, although final adoption is left to the discretion of the
Panel (Chapter A3), as well as test fishery deductions and the test fishing schedule (Chapter A5). More
detailed descriptions of the PSC Planning Model inputs, including responsibilities, is provided in Chapter
A7.

Model
The PSC Planning Model assumes a daily time step with salmon moving in groups (box-cars) through a
series of gauntlet-style mixed gear and mixed stock fisheries (Cave and Gazey 1996). Spatially, the model
covers fishing areas in both Johnstone Strait and Juan de Fuca Strait, starting with DFO statistical Areas
12 and 20 and extending into the upper mainstem of the Fraser River, DFO statistical Area 29. Daily
abundances in the most seaward areas are defined by the stock group specific forecast estimates of run
size, timing and spread in addition to the diversion rate. Daily “blocks” of salmon are then moved
through the different fishing areas and exposed to a sequential series of fisheries (Figures 1 and 2 in
Chapter A8). The different fisheries are modelled through the application of harvest rates equations. The
abundance of fish exposed to a given fishery is controlled by underlying specifications of migration rate
and the length of a fishing area. For example, fish that migrate through an area over the course of
several days may also be exposed to multiple days of fishing. Alternatively, this means that more than
one daily migratory block of fish would be exposed to a single fishery opening in a large fishing area, or
in an area in which fish are assumed to delay or slow down their migration.

Using the PSC Planning Model, the FRTC annually explores alternative fishery scenarios to optimise the
achievement of Pacific Salmon Treaty objectives (achievement of SETs and international as well as
domestic catch allocations) under various biological and/or management assumptions. This is done
during the bilateral FRTC meetings in April and June. User-inputs allow FRTC chairs to evaluate different
fishing schedules and assumed different harvest efficiencies to optimise outputs and balance
conservation, fishery, and domestic objectives. Biological and/or management inputs are varied across
scenarios to assess the sensitivity of fishing plans to changes in underlying assumptions. PSC staff
provide the necessary modelling and administrative support when running the PSC Planning Model prior
to presenting results to the Fraser River Panel for further discussion.

The current PSC Planning Model runs on a joint MS Excel and R (R Core Team 2013) operating platform.
Excel interfaces are used for entering baseline data inputs and summarising key model outputs. The
main simulation framework is coded in the statistical software R and controlled by users through an
RShiny GUI.

Results
The PSC Planning Model summarises the results of the models in a series of tables collating fishery-
specific and management related statistics (e.g. Tables 1 and 2). The FRTC chairs use these outputs to
refine preseason fishing plans and to communicate results of final model runs to the Fraser River Panel.
At the end of the June meeting, a Panel-approved “Base Case” model is adopted which can be
referenced in-season to help guide decision making for early fisheries. The alternative model runs allow
FRP and FRTC members to evaluate the sensitivity of that base case plans to different assumptions.
Model results are communicated at various levels of resolution so that fishing plans can be evaluated in
terms of meeting international (e.g. escapement targets and TAC) as well as domestic (e.g. appropriate
allocation of or distribution of fishery opportunities) objectives. In addition, model results may be used
during the domestic consultation process to help communicate anticipated fishery plans.

Planned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement
Since the inaugural use of the R-based planning model in 2019, Staff have focussed on transitioning from
a VBA to R-based GUI. Modellers continue to refine the model interface and dataflow to meet the
continuing and evolving needs of the Fraser River Panel.

Summary
The PSC Planning Model (Chapter A6) is a simulation tool used by the Fraser River Panel to
assess the sensitivity of fisheries plans and achievement of management targets to alternative
biological (e.g. run size, diversion rate) and/or management scenarios. This report describes the
key biological, management and fisheries inputs used to parameterise the PSC Planning Model
and run simulations. Further details regarding model parameterisation and underlying
assumptions can be found in Chapter A8 and A9.

Introduction
Pre-season, the Fraser River Panel (FRP) and Fraser River Technical Committee (FRTC) use the PSC
Planning Model to develop preliminary fishing plans, to identify potential limitations to achievement of
management objectives, and to explore the effect of uncertain biological and management inputs on
proposed fisheries. This simulation model requires a wide range of different inputs: biological inputs to
model the behaviour of the different stocks, fisheries inputs to assess the impact of various fisheries on
the stocks and management inputs to ensure management objectives are met. Early in the year, these
inputs are based on historical data and preliminary schedules and plans, while just prior to the start of
the season, the model inputs are replaced with improved forecasts and federally approved escapement
plans. Model seeding, or parameterisation, occurs twice per year: once in February/April and a second
time in June. The responsibility for providing different model inputs falls primarily onto Canada and the
PSC, with the U.S. providing additional domestic-level information regarding their own fisheries as well
as domestic targets and constraints. Typically, the Panel will approve the parameterisation of a “base
case” model before the conclusion of their final pre-season meeting in June based on the best-available
information.

Data

BIOLOGICAL INPUTS

The PSC Planning Model simulates the daily migration of 12 different Fraser River sockeye salmon stock
groups, in addition to a single group for all Fraser River pink salmon. Table 1 provides a list of the
different sockeye salmon stock groupings used in the Planning Model. Table 1 provides a guide for
aggregating stock-specific information from historical reconstruction and pre-season forecast files into
appropriate groupings currently utilised pre-season. These groups are structured to aggregate groups of
fish with identical management constraints and migratory parameters (Chapter A6). Table 2 provides a
description of the key biological inputs in the PSC Planning Model. Pre-season estimates of run size,
timing, spread and diversion are used to parameterise normal distributions of daily abundance entering
Johnstone Strait and Juan de Fuca Strait while delay information is used to model the upstream
migration timing of various stocks which hold in the Strait of Georgia prior to moving up-river.

Pre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans

Run size
Run size forecasts are a critical aspect of the modelling process, and directly affect the value of
management inputs, patterns of daily abundances, and strongly influence the pattern of proposed
fisheries which optimise trade-offs between conservation and fishing targets. Fisheries and Oceans
Canada (DFO) provides pre-season forecasts of sockeye salmon run size using a suite of stock
recruitment and naïve models (Grant et al. 2010, Chapter A1). These forecasts are provided at a finer
stock resolution than used by the PSC Planning Model, and so must be aggregated to the model group
level (Table 1). The uncertainty around the run size forecast is expressed in terms of a probability
distribution. As stated in the PST (Chapter 4), the median forecast (p50) is used as the default input for
the base case planning scenario, but the Panel may also choose to adopt a more precautionary or
optimistic forecast until the in-season run size estimates are available. A key sensitivity analysis
performed by the parties during pre-season fisheries planning is to vary the assumed run size from the
default median (p50) estimate to either a lower (e.g., p25), or higher (e.g., p75) estimate of abundance.
Preseason run size estimates are typically available in February and do not get updated until during the
season.

Marine timing
In the PSC Planning Model, marine timing is termed as the Area 20 50% date, or the date by which 50%
of a run has passed the mid-point of statistical Area 20 assuming all sockeye salmon migrate through the
southern approach around Vancouver Island (Chapter A2). Both the absolute timing as well as the
offsets between the timings of the various management groups (Early Stuart, Early Summer, Summer
and Late run) influence preseason fishing plans. During the spring, timings for the different stock groups
in the PSC Planning Model are calculated based on historical timing data derived from post-season
reconstructed daily marine abundance estimates (Chapter B18). Statistical and retrospective analyses
are used to determine the best available estimates for each stock in a given year. Typically, all-year
medians, cycle-line medians or all-year medians excluding 2016 cycle line data are used.

In June, DFO provides additional timing forecasts for Early Stuart and Chilko based on oceanographic
models (Folkes et al. 2018, Chapter A2). These estimates are applied directly to update the Early Stuart
and Chilko timing estimates. For all other stock groups, the historical timing is updated either earlier or
later depending on the difference between the Chilko timing forecast to the Chilko historically-based
timing estimate. This approach assumes the underlying oceanographic conditions affecting Chilko
salmon will have the same effect on other co-migrating stocks. It is at the Fraser River Panel’s discretion
to utilise these updated timing forecasts, to use the historical timing estimates, or to adopt some
alternative value.

Spread
Another parameter used to define the anticipated daily abundances of fish is the spread of the run.
Assuming the run follows a normal distribution, the spread indicates the number of days for 95% of the
run to migrate past a reference location (i.e., the standard deviation of the normal distribution). Annual
spreads are calculated from reconstructed historical marine timing profiles (Chapter B18) and are
quantified using the same subset of years selected for the historical timing estimates. Spread estimates
for aggregated stocks are calculated by first summing daily reconstructed abundances and then re-
calculating the spread of the group. The spread model inputs are only updated once a year, during the
initial model seeding process.

Northern diversion rate
The diversion rate is defined as the proportion of the run that migrates through Johnstone Strait, i.e.,
the northern approach. The models to predict the diversion rate have varied over time and will likely
continue to evolve. In 2018, a new process of predicting the diversion rate in March was applied

46

Pre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans

whereby the daily diversion rates over the last three years on the cycle line were averaged. In June, DFO
provides an additional annual forecast of the total Fraser River sockeye salmon diversion rate using a
suite of oceanographic models (Folkes et al. 2018, Chapter A2). The pattern of daily diversion based on
the historical data is then multiplied by a scaler to ensure the total diversion was equivalent to the DFO
forecast. The daily diversion rate estimates are multiplied by the daily abundances of the various stock
groups to calculate the abundances migrating through Johnstone Strait versus Juan de Fuca Strait.
Unlike other Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks, Harrison sockeye migrate predominantly through the
south. Given the limited amount of historical data, a Harrison-specific diversion rate is derived by
adjusting the diversion rate based on the historical relationship between total Fraser and Harrison-only
diversion rates.

Delay in upstream migration
A percentage of Harrison (Summer run) and Late-run stocks (excluding Birkenhead and Big Silver)
typically delay their migration in the Strait of Georgia for a variable number of days prior to continuing
their upriver migration (Cooke et al. 2004). Historically, the number of days delay and the upstream
timing has differed across cycle lines and except for odd cycle line years, cycle line medians are used as
model input. The proportion of the run that delay their upstream migration, the Mission 50% migration
date of both the delaying and non-delaying components, and the spread of the delay component are all
inputs into the PSC Planning Model. Using expert judgement, these inputs are adjusted to produce
results consistent with the historical median estimates of delay and the median 50% migration date at
Mission.

MANAGEMENT INPUTS

Most of the bi-lateral management parameters are provided by Canada, pursuant to guidance in the
Pacific Salmon Treaty (Article IV, Chapter 4). In addition, PSC staff provide test fishing deductions
(Chapter A5) and management adjustments (Chapter A3); both of which also influence the calculation of
Total Allowable Catch (TAC). Preliminary escapement plans from Canada are generally aligned with rules
corresponding to either the previous year, or previous year on the cycle line. Updated values are
normally available by June, but Ministerial approval may be delayed until early in the fishing season.

TAMs, SETs, AFEs, and LAERs
Under the Pacific Salmon Treaty (Chapter 4, Article IV), Canada is responsible for providing harvest
control rules for the management of Fraser River sockeye stocks. Prior to each fishing season, the
Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard must formally approve an annual Integrated
Fisheries Management Plan (IFMP) following a series of consultations with key stakeholder groups. This
plan includes harvest control rules that define the Spawning Escapement Targets (SET), Total Allowable
Mortality (TAM), and Low Abundance Exploitation rates (LAERs) for each sockeye salmon management
group (DFO 2018, Chapter A4). Fraser River sockeye salmon follow abundance-based harvest rules and
so the SET and TAM values vary as a function of the assumed run size. The Aboriginal Fisheries
Exemption, or AFE, is also described in the IFMP provided by Canada. This is a fixed 400,000 sockeye
deduction from the bi-lateral Total Allowable Catch (TAC) to meet Canadian First Nations fishing
requirements.

Management Adjustments
Management Adjustments (MAs) represent the expected number of additional fish required to pass the
Mission hydroacoustic facility to achieve the desired SET. Initial preseason MAs are based on historical
discrepancies, or differences between escapements at Mission and those on the spawning grounds
(DBEs), after accounting for known catch removals from historical data sets. Historical discrepancies
(Chapter A3, B22) may exist because of errors in stock assessment, catch accounting, or natural en route

47

Pre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans

losses. In June, long range environmental forecasts (Chapter B23) produced by the DFO Environmental
Watch Program are used to predict MAs for Early Stuart, Early Summer run and Summer run using
multiple regression models fit to time series of lower river discharge and temperature data (Macdonald
et al. 2010, Cummings et al. 2011). The Late-run MA is either left as the historical median or updated to
a predicted MA estimate based on estimated upstream timing (Macdonald et al. 2010, Cummings et al.
2011). However, the Panel may choose alternative MAs for any of the management groups.

Table 3. A description of the key management inputs in the PSC Fisheries Planning model.

Test fishery deductions
Pursuant to the PST (Article 4, Chapter 4), the TAC is reduced by the amount of catch in Panel authorised
test fisheries. Test fishing catches consist of nondiscretionary catch of fish that are unavoidably killed
when conducting test fishing operations and discretionary catches retained to offset test fishing costs.
Preseason, the Panel agrees to a draft test fishing plan put forth by PSC staff. A detailed description of
how test fishery deductions are predicted for pre-season planning is provided in Chapter A5. Estimated
catches by fishery are calculated from historical catchability estimates applied to simulated daily fish
abundances. Gill net test fisheries are assumed to retain all fish, whereas purse seine fisheries are
modelled as either non-retention (fish are only landed to meet scientific sampling requirements) vs.
retention (all fish are landed and fish in excess of the sampling requirements are used to offset the cost
of the test fishing program).

The distribution of test fishing catches across management groups is calculated using a combination of
two approaches. First, the non-discretionary catch (i.e., all gill net test fishery catch plus scientific
samples in the purse seine test fishery) is proportionally assigned to each group based on the historical
distribution of non-discretionary catches average over the last 3 cycle lines and adjusted for the current
proposed test fishery dates. Second, the discretionary catch (i.e., fish landed above and beyond those
required for scientific samples), is proportionally distributed as a function of the available harvestable
surplus for each management group (i.e., run size minus spawning escapement target and management

adjustment). These approaches are sometimes revised to meet the expected stock composition and/or
test fishery schedule assumed for a given year.

International and domestic allocations
The PST (Article 4, Chapter 4) assigns 16.5% of the TAC available for international sharing to the U.S.
with the balance assigned to Canada. In addition, each country allocates their respective share across
different stake-holder groups following pre-season consultations. These percentages are then used as
objectives to help guide the fishing plans in the PSC Planning Model. Canada assigns allocations to
different commercial fishing sectors: Area B seine, Area D gill net, Area E gill net, Area H troll, and Area G
troll. Allocation targets are also specified for marine, lower river, and interior First Nations fisheries as
well as marine and in-river recreational fisheries. In the US, allocation percentages are used to divide the
TAC between Tribal and All Citizen fisheries.

FISHERIES INPUTS

Fisheries inputs relate to the number of vessels expected to participate to a fishery, i.e., the fishing
effort, or expected catches and the schedule when fishing is expected to occur. Table 4 provides a
description of the key fisheries inputs in the PSC Planning Model.

Table 4. A description of the key fisheries inputs in the PSC Fisheries Planning model.

Fishing effort
Effort-based harvest rate equations are used in the PSC Planning Model to generate estimates of catch
for derby-style fisheries. The model is seeded with historical estimates of fishing effort (total number of
vessels) for the following fisheries: marine gillnet (Area 11, Area 12), marine purse seine (Area 12, Area
13 and Area 20), troll (Area 29), Tribal (Area 4B56C, Area 7, Area 7A), and All Citizen (Area 7, Area 7A).

Fixed catch (for fisheries not modelled dynamically)
Some fisheries are not dynamically modelled within the PSC Planning Model, either because of
unparameterized harvest equations, or because they are outside of the current geographic scope.
Instead, experts provide estimates of catch by management group, including estimates of fishing
induced sockeye mortalities (FIMs) in pink salmon directed fisheries. The Canadian FRTC chair provides
catch estimates for the following fisheries: marine recreational catch, in-river beach seine FIMs, and gulf
seine FIMs. PSC staff will provide catches estimates for the purse seine test fishing samples. These
catches are relatively small and are estimated based on daily sample sizes and distributed across
management groups based on historical stock composition information.

Fishing plans
Once the model has been fully parameterised under a given set of assumptions, the FRTC works with
PSC Staff to develop a fishing plan for each country. The goal of these plans is to optimise trade-offs

49

Pre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans

between conservation and fishing objectives by developing fishing scenarios that meet Spawning
Escapement Targets, come as close as possible to meeting the international TAC allocations as well as
domestic allocation requirements. Model input requirements vary by fishery depending on the
underlying equations. At a minimum, derby-style fisheries must include a start and end date, while ITQ-
style fisheries (Individual Transferable Quota) must also indicate an anticipated target catch. Users can
choose to specify the hours of fishing operations, the fishing effort and if sockeye catches would be
retained or not. Initial fishing plans developed in March/April are updated and finalised following an
update of the model inputs in June.

A8. Planning Model - Biological Assumptions

M.J. Hague

Summary
The PSC Planning Model (Chapter A6) is a simulation tool used by the Fraser River Panel to
assess different alternative fisheries plans and their ability to achieve management targets
under various biological (e.g., run size, diversion rate) and/or management scenarios. The
calculations of catch and escapement by the Planning Model (Chapter A9) rely fundamentally
on assumptions associated with forward run reconstructions. This report describes the key
assumptions regarding the dynamics of fish movement and migration behaviour. The sources
and processes underlying the annual re-parameterisation of the biological and fisheries
management inputs feeding into the model are provided in Chapter A7.

Introduction
As described in Chapter A6, and pursuant to Article IV, Chapter 4, Paragraph 9d, of the Pacific Salmon
Treaty, the Fraser River Technical Committee (FRTC) and Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) staff work
jointly to develop fisheries management plans for Fraser River sockeye salmon prior to the start of each
fishing season using the PSC Planning Model. The usefulness of the Planning Model as a management
tool depends in part on the accuracy of biological pre-season forecasts, but also on the realism of the
underlying model parameterisations, primarily those relating to fish movement and vulnerability to
fishery operations.

Fundamentally, the Planning Model is a forward reconstruction model (Cave and Gazey 1996, Starr and
Hilborn 1998), simulating the daily migrations of sockeye salmon as they “move” through a gauntlet of
marine and freshwater fisheries. The model uses fishery-specific instantaneous mortality rates applied
to vulnerable “blocks” of salmon to estimate fisheries-specific catches and escapement (Chapter A9).
Since the original publication of the forward reconstruction model by Cave and Gazey (1996), the
assumptions underlying the model have been changed to reflect both improved information about
stock-specific differences in salmon migratory behaviour, and changes to fisheries and management
strategies (Chapter A9). Biologically, a larger number of individual stock groups are modelled given the
availability of more detailed stock-specific data since the advancement of DNA-based stock
identification technology. Increased understanding of stock-specific fish migration behaviour has also
resulted in changes to modelling approaches for diversion rate (percentage of fish migrating via
Johnstone Strait vs. Juan de Fuca Strait) and delay in the Strait of Georgia. The following report describes
the main biological assumptions underlying the simulation model.

Reconstruction Model Assumptions

NORMAL RUN TIMING DISTRIBUTIONS

Within the PSC Planning Model, ‘stocks’ are defined as aggregates of fish with a unique set of migration
characteristics such as: migratory path, migration rates, delay behaviour, marine arrival timing, and
abundance. These stock groups are based on the four different Fraser River management groups but
with additional sub-groups based on migration differentiation. For example, Late-run fish are divided
into additional groups depending on whether they migrate through Johnstone Strait (North) or through
Juan de Fuca Strait (South), whether or not they delay their upstream migration, and whether they

51

Pre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans

spawn below or above the confluence of the Harrison River. The full suite of Planning Model stock
groups and migration parameters are described in Chapter A7 (Tables 1 and 2). The biological model for
each stock (s) is initialised by creating a series of normally distributed daily migration profiles centred on
an index of expected median marine migration timing:

(1)  𝑁(𝑑) = 𝑁 ∙

2

1
2

∙(

𝑑−𝜇
𝜎

)

∙ 𝑒−

1

𝜎√2𝜋

where N is the total forecasted abundance (run size) of a stock, d is day, σ is the standard deviation, and
μ is the median marine migration date of the run (Figure 1). The marine migration date, also referred to
as the Area 20 date or marine 50% date, indicates the date when half (50%) of the run would have
passed through Area 20 assuming all fish migrated via that route. The normal distributions are
parameterised using pre-season forecasts of abundance, timing and standard deviation (see Chapter
A7).

Next, a daily diversion rate pattern (i.e. proportion of the run migrating around the northern tip of
Vancouver Island instead of through Juan de Fuca Strait) is applied to create separate entry distributions
for the northern and southern approaches around Vancouver Island (Figure 1). Alternative diversion rate
patterns can be applied to individual stocks to accommodate known differences in migratory routes.
Fish migrating through the southern approach are initiated in Area 127 off the southwest coast of
Vancouver Island, and fish migrating through the northern approach are initiated in Area 111 off the
northern tip of the island (Figure 1).

BOX-CAR FORWARD RECONSTRUCTION ASSUMPTIONS

Once the daily abundance estimates, representing Fraser River sockeye expected to migrate through the
north and south, are derived, the model uses a set of control rules to move fish through space and time

52

Pre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans

from the tip of Vancouver Island to the Mission hydroacoustic site, and then continuing up the
mainstem. Terminal fisheries harvests or catch excess to spawning escapement requirements (ESSRs)
are not specifically addressed within the current modelling construct.

The forward reconstruction assumes a ‘boxcar’ style movement of fish occurring on a daily time-step
(Cave and Gazey 1996, Starr and Hilborn 1998) over most of the migration. A ‘bathtub’ assumption is
also applied, meaning that on a given day fish are either fully vulnerable to, or completely unaffected by,
an assumed fishery opening. Migration times, and thus the exposure of a given daily migration ‘block’ of
fish to a given fishery, are controlled by underlying stock-specific migration rates and lengths of each
fishing area (Appendix A, Table A1). It is assumed that fish remain in a statistical area for a minimum of
one day and migration times are rounded to full daily increments. Statistical areas associated with
residency times greater than one day are represented by multiple model sub-areas, each representing
roughly one day of migration time in the model (Appendix A, Table A1). In some cases, statistical areas
represent parallel migration routes (e.g., Area 20, Areas 4B, 5, 6, and 6C) and for migration purposes
they are considered identical but are still identified uniquely for the purposes of catch accounting (i.e.,
fish are assumed to migrate simultaneously through Canadian Area 20 and US Area 4B56C).

Figure 2 illustrates how the boxcar movement assumptions interact with fishery exposure during the
forward reconstruction. Exposure times depend on the dates of the fishery opening, the migration rate
of the fish, and the size of the fishing area. In some cases, the same group of fish could be exposed to
fishing pressure across multiple days of a fishery opening, while in others, a group of fish may only be
vulnerable to a fishery for part of an opening.

Figure 2. Schematic illustration of a basic boxcar run reconstruction model. The colored bars
represent different statistical fishing areas, with the left most square representing the most
seaward location. Each “fish/hook” represents one day of fishing. Each fish represents one daily
block of fish. Black fish in each panel are not exposed to a fishery opening on a given day, while
grey fish are. Each panel represents a daily time-step. The top panel represents the shape of the
unfished run prior to entering marine approach fisheries. The bottom panel represents the shape
of the run at Mission, with certain days of abundance reduced due to catch removals.

Pre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans

Following the illustration in Figure 2, the escapement of fish (N) into area (a) on a given day (d) is
reduced by an amount equivalent to the landed catches and fishing induced mortalities (FIMs) occurring
on that day in that area. Assuming it takes one day for the fish to migrate through area a, the resulting
escapement of fish into the downstream area (a+1) on the next day (d+1) is represented by:

(2)  𝑁𝑎+1(𝑑 + 1) = 𝑁𝑎(𝑑) − 𝐶𝑎(𝑑)

The resulting daily escapement into the Fraser River (NFR), after migrating for m days through all areas
along the migration route and being intercepted by k fisheries along the way, is given by:

STRAIT OF GEORGIA MIGRATION DELAY BEHAVIOUR

The exception to boxcar movement occurs in the Strait of Georgia near the Fraser River Delta, where a
proportion of the Late-run and Harrison stocks delay their migration prior to moving upstream (Lapointe
et al. 2003). Delaying fish are assumed to both slow down, and to redistribute when entering the Fraser
River, thus violating the assumptions of a boxcar model. Subsequent to river entry, boxcar movement is
assumed to resume for the remainder of the freshwater migration. A separate sub-model is applied to
model stocks which hold and redistribute in the Strait of Georgia (Table 1, see also Chapter A7), for
which a set of parameters that characterise the period of delay, and the new profile of upstream
migration, are defined. Note that this sub-model does not apply to Late run or Harrison sockeye that do
not delay their upstream migration

To mimic delay behaviour of delaying Late run and Harrison sockeye, the model adjusts the number of
fish remaining in the Strait of Georgia (NSoG) and the number of fish migrating into the lower river on a
daily basis. This is done by assuming that delaying salmon fish accumulate over time in the Strait of
Georgia, with a proportion of the available abundance migrating upstream:

(4)  𝑁𝐹𝑅(𝑑) = 𝑝(𝑑) ∙ 𝑁𝑇,𝑆𝑜𝐺(𝑑),

where p(d) indicates the proportion of the abundance holding in the Strait of Georgia migrating into the
Fraser River (FR), and NT,SoG indicates the total accumulated abundance remaining in the Strait of
Georgia, following fisheries removals. The daily proportion of available fish migrating upstream is
derived from a normal density function representing the run timing profile of a delaying stock as it exits
the Strait of Georgia and enters the Fraser River, where σ is the standard deviation, and μ is the
upstream timing:

(5)

𝑓(𝑑) =

1
2

∙(

𝑑−𝜇
𝜎

∙ 𝑒−

2
)
.

1

𝜎√2𝜋

The proportion of delaying fish associated with each day of migration (p(d)) is then given by dividing the
proportion of fish migrating upstream by the proportion of fish still present in the Strait of Georgia:

(6)

𝑝(𝑑) =

𝑓(𝑑)
𝐷
∑ 𝑓(𝑑)
𝑑

.

Because sockeye are assumed to accumulate in the Strait of Georgia, the daily abundance of out-
migrating delay fish cannot simply be removed by subtracting from a single day of resident abundance
(i.e. cannot be treated the same as a daily catch removal). Instead, the model makes the simplifying

54

Pre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans

assumption that the total reduction in fish due to outmigration is spread proportionally across the
remaining abundance in the Strait:

(7)

𝑝𝑆𝑜𝐺(𝑑) =

𝑁𝑆𝑜𝐺(𝑑)
𝐷
∑ 𝑁𝑆𝑜𝐺(𝑑)
𝑑

, with  𝑁𝑆𝑜𝐺(𝑑) = 𝑁𝑆𝑜𝐺(𝑑 − 1) −   𝐶𝑆𝑜𝐺(𝑑 − 1).

The result of this assumption is that the daily stock composition of sockeye entering the river from the
Strait of Georgia will not mirror the daily stock composition entering the Strait of Georgia.

The shape of the remaining distribution fish in the Strait of Georgia after each day of upstream
migration (NFR) and catch (CSoG) is then calculated using:

(8)  𝑁𝑆𝑜𝐺(𝑑 + 1) = 𝑁𝑆𝑜𝐺(𝑑) − 𝑝𝑎(𝑑) ∙ 𝑁𝐹𝑅(𝑑).

In the next loop of the simulation, the escapement into the river is equivalent to the abundance out-
migrating from the Strait (NFR) and the escapement into the Strait (NSOG) becomes re-defined by
Equation 8. Due to the iterative nature of this calculation, daily escapement into the river is populated
one day at a time, even in the absence of any fisheries.

Planned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement
The fisheries planning model and marine reconstruction model used to occur within the same
framework and had a shared set of underlying assumptions. In recent years, some of the basic biological
assumptions (e.g., movement rate) have diverged, and should be reconciled. There has been some
interest in improving the modelling of pink salmon fisheries as well as upriver fisheries, some of which
are currently entered as fixed inputs in the model. Modellers also continue to revise and improve the
coding efficiency and user interfaces and address ongoing requests from the Fraser River Panel and
Technical Committee.

A9. Harvest Rate Parameterisation and Catch
Dynamics

M.J. Hague

Summary
The PSC Planning Model (Chapter A6) is a simulation tool used by the Fraser River Panel to
assess alternative fisheries plans and their ability to achieve management targets under various
biological (e.g., run size, diversion rate) and/or management scenarios. This report describes
the fisheries included in the model as well as the different approaches for calculating catch and
escapement based on daily estimates of sockeye abundance in the various fishing areas. The
underlying migration assumptions are described in Chapter A8. The sources and processes used
to derive the biological and fisheries management inputs to parameterise the model are
provided in Chapter A7.

Introduction
As described in Chapter A6, and pursuant to Article IV, Chapter 4, Paragraph 9d, of the Pacific Salmon
Treaty, the Fraser River Technical Committee (FRTC) and Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) staff work
jointly to develop fisheries and management plans for Fraser River sockeye salmon prior to the start of
each fishing season using the PSC Planning Model. The usefulness of the Planning Model as a
management tool depends in part on the accuracy of pre-season biological forecasts, but also on the
realism of the underlying model parameterisations, such as assumed harvest rate dynamics and the
vulnerability of migrating salmon to fisheries openings.

The types of fisheries targeting Fraser River sockeye salmon, and the management rules used to guide
them, have changed substantially since the Planning Model was first described by Cave and Gazey
(1996). For example, many Canadian commercial fisheries in marine areas have changed from high
intensity “derby” style fisheries, to protracted, lower-impact, individual transferable quota (ITQ)
fisheries. In addition, the Planning Model now monitors the impact of both landed catch and fishing
induced mortalities (FIMs) on estimated escapements; a relatively new concern due to increased
interest in Fraser River pink salmon directed fisheries and the need for accurate accounting of
exploitation rates associated with vulnerable Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks.

Daily fishery catches within the Planning Model are both a function of the abundance and vulnerability
of the salmon exposed to a given opening as well as a function of the assumed harvest rates of the
fishery, or fisheries, operating in a given area on a given day. The following report describes the
assumptions, parameterisations, and control rules used to quantify both the abundance of the
vulnerable fish population and the fishery-induced mortality rates associated with individual fisheries.
Resulting daily catch and escapement calculations are also defined as well as areas for future
refinement.

Planning Model Catch Assumptions

FISHERY HARVEST RATE DEFINITIONS

A detailed description of fishery parameterisations within the Planning Model can be found in Table A1.
There are four categories of fisheries within the model that are characterised by different harvest rate

57

Pre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans

equations and associated parameter requirements: derby fisheries, mixed gear fisheries, ITQ fisheries,
and test fisheries. Each category is described in more detail below.

Derby Fisheries
Harvest rate equations for many of the derby fisheries were parameterised with data from the 1980’s
and 1990’s (Cave and Gazey 1996); Table A1. Catch is a function of the number of vessels, the assumed
harvest rate per vessel, and the length of the opening. Historically, these fisheries were characterised by
a short fishing window, high fishing effort (E, number of vessels participating to the fishery), and often
intensive fishery exploitation. As a result, original harvest rate parameterisations were sometimes
characterised for 12-hour openings, in which case the ‘elemental’ harvest rates (u) defined by Cave and
Gazey (1996) were first re-scaled to daily harvest rates (h):

(1)

ℎ = 2 ∙ 𝑢 + 𝑢2,  with 𝑢 = 𝑎 + 𝑏 ∙ 𝐸

where ‘a’ and ‘b’ are fishery-specific parameters (Table A1) relating effort to harvest rate. In other cases
(Table 1), daily harvest rates were parameterised as a function of effort and fishery catchability (q)
estimated from historical reconstructions:

(2)

ℎ = 1 − 𝑒−𝑞𝐸

Many of the FSC fisheries are modelled with a single daily harvest rate (h), which is informed by the
expert judgement of fishery managers and may change at the discretion of the Canadian Technical
Committee Chair. Often, the intention of these harvest rates is not to accurately reconstruct catches,
but to seed the Planning Model with reasonable harvest expectations and to meet domestic catch
constraints.

U.S. Mixed Gear Fisheries
The current harvest rate equations applied to US All Citizen and Tribal fisheries operating in statistical
Areas 6, 7, and 7A were originally parameterised based on analyses performed in the 1980s (PSC 1990).
The effort (E; quantified as number of vessels or number of landings) in these mixed gear fisheries is
quantified in terms of “purse seine equivalents”. A fixed gill net to purse seine catch-per-unit-effort
CPUE ratio is applied to re-scale the number of gill net vessels (GN) participating (or modelled) during a
fishery opening into a “purse seine equivalent” (EPS):

(3)  𝐸𝑃𝑆 =

𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝐺𝑁
𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑃𝑆

∙ 𝐸𝐺𝑁

where E refers to fishing effort.

The Planning Model applies a fixed 0.2 CPUE ratio to “convert” the number of gill net vessels into an
equivalent number of purse seine vessels (i.e., the effort associated with five gill nets is equivalent to the
effort of one purse seine). The original analysis resulting in the application of the CPUE ratio for effort
scaling has not been identified, although similar conversions of vessel effort to purse seine equivalents
using CPUE ratios have been applied in other fisheries. e.g., herring fisheries in the North Sea (Bjorndal
and Conrad 1978).

Harvest rates for the US mixed gear fisheries are also assumed to vary across the season (elemental
harvest rates, uearly vs. ulate in Table A1). The historical analysis of purse seine equivalents from the 1980s
(PSC 1990) noted that catchability in the Area 7 and 7A fisheries decreased in mid- to late August,

58

Pre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans

potentially associated with lower catchability of Late-run fish due to behavioural differences in
migration patterns (e.g. swimming lower in the water column and less accessible to gear). However, PSC
Staff also hypothesized that observed seasonal differences in catchability could be associated with
estimation errors related to uncertainty in Late-run reconstructions (PSC 1990). The Planning Model
somewhat arbitrarily assigns a date of August 12 in Area 7 and August 14 in Area 7A to switch from
“early” to “late” harvest rates, as the stock composition generally becomes weighted more heavily
towards Late-run stock components around this time. However, modellers have the flexibility to
redefine the time periods over which to apply each harvest rate equation.

ITQ Fisheries
Canada’s Area B, E and H fisheries currently operate under an Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ)
system. Their fisheries are modelled by ‘spreading’ the total catch target (CT) over the duration of the
fishery opening (n) which may last 1 to 7 days (d):

(4)

 𝐶(𝑑) = 𝐶𝑇/𝑛.

For fisheries openings spanning multiple statistical areas (e.g. Area 12 and 13 purse seine), the total
daily catch is proportionally assigned to each area (a) based on fishing effort (E, number of vessels):

(5)

 𝐶𝑎1(𝑑) =

𝐸𝑎1
𝐴
∑ 𝐸𝑎
𝑎1

∙ 𝐶𝑇(𝑑).

On a given day, the catch is converted to a harvest rate (h) by dividing the catch by the number of
salmon exposed to the fishery:

(6)

 ℎ(𝑑) = 𝐶(𝑑) 𝑁(𝑑)

⁄

The resulting harvest rate is then applied across the different stock groups, assuming equal catchability.
Daily harvest rates are capped at thresholds (hT) to prevent unrealistic catches at low fish abundance:

(7)

 ℎ(𝑑) = 𝑚𝑖𝑛 {

ℎ𝑇,
𝐶(𝑑)

𝑁(𝑑)

}.

If daily catch targets are not met early in the opening (i.e., C(d) < CT(d)), the remaining catch is
redistributed across subsequent days until the total catch target (CT) is reached:

(8)

𝐼𝑓 𝐶(𝑑) < 𝐶𝑇 ,  𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝐶(𝑑 + 1: 𝐷 − 1) = 𝐶𝑇 − ∑

𝐷
𝑑=1

𝐶(𝑑)

,

where CT is the total target catch over the course of an ITQ opening, d is fishing day, and D is the number
of days in an opening. This approach assumes that the fishery will operate in a manner which increases
the probability of reaching the target catch applied to the opening.

Test Fisheries
Gill net test fisheries are assumed to land all catches estimated using historically derived, time varying,
harvest rates (Chapter B4). Landed catches from purse seine test fisheries to meet scientific sampling
requirements are calculated outside of the Planning Model and entered as fixed catch deductions
(Chapter A5). By default, all other sockeye encountered by the purse seine test fisheries are assumed to

59

Pre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans

be released. However, to offset the cost of test fishing operations in some years, the purse seine test
fisheries may retain their sockeye, and/or pink salmon catch on some days. During retention periods,
the purse seine test fisheries are modelled using the ITQ catch equations, with total target catches and
opening dates provided by PSC Staff.

CATCH AND ESCAPEMENT PROJECTIONS

Fish Vulnerability
In addition to the harvest rate calculations, the catch on a given day of a fishery opening will also
depend on the number of fish vulnerable to the opening. As discussed in Chapter A8, the Planning
Model assumes that fish migrate through fishing areas on a daily time-step and assuming fixed order of
movement (i.e. “boxcar” reconstruction). The number of daily blocks of fish migration exposed to a
fishery depend on the size of the management area, the number of days a fishery is open, and the speed
with which salmon migrate through the fishery. In some cases, the same group of fish might be exposed
to fishing pressure over multiple days of an opening, or in sequential openings occurring in downstream
areas. The Planning Model calculates the number of fish escaping from a fishery on a daily basis, so that
the vulnerable population becomes smaller over multiple days of exposure.

Instantaneous Harvest Rates
To facilitate the modelling of simultaneous fisheries and short-fishery openings (< 1 day), daily harvest
rates (h) were re-scaled in the current Planning model as instantaneous fishing mortality rates (F) ,
where:

(9)  𝐹 = (−1 ∗ 𝑙𝑜𝑔(1 − ℎ)).

The resulting catch for a single day is then calculated as:

(10)  𝐶(𝑑) =   (1 − 𝑒−𝐹) ∙ 𝑁(𝑑)

where C(d) is catch on a given day, N(d) is the total number of fish exposed to a given fishery (i.e., may
include one or multiple daily “blocks” of fish migration) and d is fishing day. The above re-scaling does
not impact catch estimation when there is only a single fishery targeting a block of fish, but becomes
important during simultaneous fishery modelling. Catch on subsequent days, or in subsequent areas, is
then a function of the number of fish in each daily migration block escaping from the previous opening,
where N(d+1) is the total abundance escaping from the fishery on day d:

(11)

𝑁(𝑑 + 1) = 𝑁(𝑑) − 𝐶(𝑑).

Fisheries removals are indexed both by fishing day, as well as by daily migration block to calculate both
daily escapements and to summarise catches. The model also summarises daily escapement from every
statistical area for each stock. The impact of changes to fishing area size, partial area closures, assumed
slowing or speeding up of fish through an area etc., can all be easily modelled through a simple change
to the data input files.

Instantaneous fishing mortality equations can be expanded to model multiple simultaneous sources of
mortality, such as when more than one fishery is operating in the same area at the same time, or with
the potential future inclusion of natural sources of mortality. To do so, the total catch is first calculated
using:

60

Pre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans

(12)

 𝐶(𝑑) = (1 − 𝑒− ∑ 𝐹𝑛

1 ) ∙ 𝑁(𝑑)

The catch is then partitioned across n fisheries (or alternative sources of mortality) using:

(13)

 𝐶(𝑑)𝑛 = 𝐶(𝑑) ∗

𝐹𝑛
∑ 𝐹𝑛
1

While derby fisheries can operate simultaneously and for fractions of a day, an order of operations must
still be assumed for ITQ fisheries. By default, ITQ fisheries operating in the same area on the same date
are assumed to take place after any simultaneous derby fisheries, i.e., ITQ harvest rate equations are
based on the abundance of fish escaping from concurrent derby fisheries. From a practical standpoint,
this model simplification only impacts ITQ catches in scenarios of low abundance relative to target catch,
in which case harvest thresholds may be triggered.

Fishery Induced Mortalities (FIMs)
In addition to landed catch, the Planning Model also models the mortality associated with the non-
retention of sockeye catches during pink-directed fishery openings i.e., fishery induced mortalities
(FIMs). The assumed loss of fish is calculated by multiplying the harvest rate associated with a directed
fishery by a gear-specific FIM rate (see Table A1). For the purposes of escapement calculations, FIMs are
removed from daily migration blocks of salmon in the same way as landed catch; however, FIMs are
tracked separately for the purposes of catch accounting.

Planned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement
Most harvest rate equations within the Planning Model were parameterised using data from years with
very different fisheries, and fish conditions compared to current. It also has been noted that some of the
US harvest rate equations produce negative values when fleet size drops below a certain threshold.

Given the changes in fish abundance, fleet size, and fishing technology over the last 40 years, the
parameterisation of these fisheries (Table A1) requires updating and should be interpreted with caution.

B1. PSC Test Fisheries

E. Taylor

Summary
The Pacific Salmon Commission funds and operates test fisheries to inform bilateral decisions of
the Fraser River Panel through the collection of data on Fraser River sockeye and pink salmon in
southern British Columbia and northern Washington State. These test fisheries provide
information on abundance, timing, and diversion rates as well as species and stock composition
information for use in stock assessments to inform fisheries management. PSC Secretariat
involvement in these test fisheries ranges from financial assistance to complete responsibility
for day-to-day operations. This report outlines the purpose of Panel approved PSC test
fisheries, administrative responsibilities, as well as funding of the test fishing program.

Introduction
The Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC), and its predecessor the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries
Commission, have operated test fisheries to obtain data required to inform bilateral decisions of the
Fraser River Panel since the 1960s. These test fisheries are authorised under the Pacific Salmon Treaty to
assess Fraser River sockeye and pink salmon and occur in three key geographic areas (Figure 1): the
northern and southern marine approaches to the Fraser River (Johnstone Strait, and the Strait of Juan
de Fuca, respectively) and the lower Fraser River.

Figure 1. Map of PSC test fisheries, consisting of marine test fisheries in Johnstone Strait (Round
Island and Naka Creek gillnet test fisheries, Upper (Area 12/Blinkhorn) and Lower (Area 13)
Johnstone Strait purse seine fisheries) and Juan de Fuca Strait (Area 20 gillnet and purse seine test
fisheries, Neah Bay (Area 4B,5) gillnet test fishery, Area 7 US reef net test fishery), in the Strait of
Georgia (Gulf troll test fishery) and in-river gillnet test fisheries at Cottonwood, Brownsville Bar,
Whonnock and Qualark.

Test fishing is the deployment of fishing efforts to gather information about fish either moving through
or residing in a particular area. This is done by deployment of consistent fishing effort in a particular

66

In-season Assessments: Fisheries Information

area so that quantitative catch and biological data can be used for fisheries stock assessments (Chapter
B19). Test fisheries are sometimes equipped with specialized fishing gear in order to target or avoid
certain species or stocks. Additionally, test fisheries have observers aboard the vessels to monitor effort
and catch (Chapter B2) as well as collect biological data and samples (Chapter B5) for use in stock
assessment. Gear types used by the PSC test fisheries include purse seines, gill nets (both single and
variable mesh), troll/hook and line, and reef nets.

Purpose of PSC Test Fisheries
The specific purposes of each PSC test fishery varies, but collectively their data are used in conjunction
with information from the in-river hydro-acoustics program to provide in-season estimates of run size,
timing and diversion of Fraser River sockeye and pink salmon management units. Table 1 provides an
overview of the different PSC Panel approved test fisheries. The raw data provided by the test fisheries
are catch by stock and species (based on sampling), effort, and other biological information such as age,
sex, and weight (Chapter B6). Collectively across the test fishery program, these data are used as inputs
to the PSC models to assess abundance (Chapter B18), timing, the diversion rate, stock (Chapters B7-B9)
and species composition (Chapter B16), vulnerability (which stocks are susceptible to capture by
particular gear in particular areas) and catchability (the proportion of the available abundance captured
per unit of effort) (Chapters B3-B4). In addition to providing inputs into the PSC’s in-season modeling
process, the data from various test fisheries are sometimes used to project the magnitude of catches in
potential fisheries. Individual test fisheries can also provide relevant information on local abundances
for certain users. Finally, many of the test fisheries also catch non-target stocks and other salmon
species, which provides an incidental source of information on those stocks and species.

During 2016 and 2017, two workshops were commissioned to compile available information on historic
and existing test fisheries, to gather input from a variety of experts in both Canada and the United
States, as well as to undertake technical analyses. The results of these workshops and resulting technical
review was published in a technical report and provides further details regarding the purpose of the
various test fisheries (Nelitz et al. 2018).

ADMINISTRATION

Panel approved test fisheries are operated in-season to provide information to the Panel in support of
Fraser River sockeye and pink salmon management. All Panel approved test fisheries are overseen by
PSC Secretariat staff and the Panel. They are funded and approved through the Panel process and any
decisions that 1) influence the financial state of the PSC test fishing program, 2) affect mortality of
Fraser River sockeye and pink salmon, or 3) affect the Panels ability to manage Fraser River sockeye and
pink salmon are made by the Panel with advice from PSC staff. In general, day-to-day operations are the
responsibilities of PSC staff, DFO staff, and First Nations administrators and major decisions and
direction is the responsibility of the Panel.

Test fisheries fall under two categories depending on whether they occur within Panel Area waters or
not (Figure 2). Test fisheries occurring in Areas 12 and 13 as well as upstream of the Mission Bridge take
place in Non-Panel Area waters, are operated by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), and involve
administrative assistance from First Nations whose traditional territory the test fisheries are operated
within. The test fisheries within Johnstone Strait are administered by the Namgis A-Tlegay Fisheries
Partnership. The Qualark Gillnet test fishery, located in the Fraser canyon near Yale, is operated by DFO
with support from Yale First Nation. DFO is responsible for selecting test fishing contractors and fish
buyers. The remaining test fisheries occur within Panel Area waters and are operated by PSC Secretariat
staff. Selection of test fishers and buyers, as well as financial accounting for these test fisheries are all
performed by PSC Secretariat staff.

FUNDING

The funding of test fisheries has changed substantially over the years. In 2006, a decision from the
Federal Court of Canada determined that it was illegal for the federal government to set aside a portion
of a public resource, i.e. fish, to finance research activities (Larocque v. Canada 2006). Prior to the
Larocque decision, test fishers could be paid based on a portion of the value of the test fishing catch and
fish could be retained above and beyond the amount needed to pay for the test fishing program.
Between 2006 and 2012, the Canadian federal government’s ability to retain fish to finance research
activities was in flux. These years, referred to as “The Larocque Years”, were characterized by changes to
fisher payments and policies regarding the retention of fish. Fishers were required to be paid a fixed
daily rate, and only fish required for samples and those unavoidably killed during test fishing activities
could be sold. Currently, fishers are still paid a fixed rate but additional fish retention to fund test fishing
activities is possible under the Test Fishing Policy (PSC 2021a).

While the test fishing program is generally funded through the sale of fish, recently the sale of fish from
the test fisheries is insufficient to cover the costs of the test fishing program in most years. In this case,
Canada and the US are responsible for funding the remainder of the test fishing costs and do so through
the use of the Test Fishing Revolving Fund (TFRF). The PSC maintains the TFRF to stabilize the financial
status of the PSC test fishing program. Contributions to the revolving fund are either made directly by
the Parties, or from surpluses from the sale of fish caught and retaining in the test fisheries.
Withdrawals from the revolving fund occur in years where test fishing operational costs exceed incomes
generated from the sale of fish. The Test Fishing Policy and Financial Regulation was developed by the
Parties in 2021 to outline the criteria required for the discretionary retention of fish as well as to define
the regulations determining how deficits and surpluses would be shared by the Parties (PSC 2021b).

Planned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement
Many of the planned changes and potential areas of improvement are outlined in the Summary of a
Review of Fraser River Test Fisheries (Nelitz et al. 2018). In addition, there are ongoing modifications to
the test fishing program to reduce costs and increase the information gained per dollar spent.

B2. Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) Calculations

E. Taylor

Summary
Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) is arguably the most important test fishing data to estimate
abundances. The Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) relies on four different test fishing gear
types to assess the abundance of Fraser River sockeye salmon: 1) seine nets, 2) gill nets, 3)
troll/hook and line, and 4) reef nets. In most cases the calculation of CPUE is based on catch
and fishing effort, whereby the effort will be gear dependent. But in some cases, the CPUE may
be corrected to account for gear saturation or other factors that may bias the relationship
between abundance and CPUE. The following report provides an overview of the calculation of
CPUE for the different PSC test fisheries.

Introduction
As part of the Pacific Salmon Treaty agreements (PST 2020, Chapter 4), the Fraser River Panel is
responsible for conducting test fisheries on Fraser River sockeye salmon. Test fishery data include catch-
per-unit-effort (CPUE) data that, when multiplied by an expansion line (inverse catchability, Chapters B3-
B4), provides an estimate of daily abundance. CPUE data are calculated differently depending on the
type of gear and the associated measure of fishing effort. The four gear types employed by PSC test
fisheries are purse seine, gill net, troll, and reef net. Additionally, the in-river gill nets differ slightly from
their marine counterparts and require the use of a catchability correction factor when catches are above
a certain level. The following report will describe the calculation of CPUE for each of the four gear types.

Data
Before discussing CPUE calculations, it is important to define what catch and fishing effort data will be
used in the calculation of CPUE. During test fishing operations, the quality of catch data is often
negatively impacted by weather, equipment failure, and/or tides and currents. Under these
circumstances, the test fishing skipper and observer are asked to assign a quality score of 2, 1, or 0 to
the collected data. A score of 2 signifies that the data is of good quality and there were no issues to
note. A quality score of 1 signifies that there were one or more issues with the collected data, but that
the skipper and observer agreed that the issues did not result in the catch being unrepresentative of
what would have been caught had there been no issues. Finally, a quality score of 0 signifies that the
skipper and observer deem the catch being unrepresentative of what would have been caught had no
issues occurred. All catch data with a set quality score of 0 are marked as non-assessment data and are
excluded from calculations of CPUE.

Methods

PURSE SEINE TEST FISHERIES

The calculation of sockeye CPUE in the purse seine test fisheries is the simplest among all the gear types,
as the total sockeye purse seine catch on a given day (C) is divided by the number of assessment sets
performed, i.e. the fishing effort (E):

(1)

𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸 =

𝐶
𝐸

71

In-season Assessments: Fisheries Information

Under normal circumstances, the purse seine test fisheries perform six sets per day. In case of
mechanical failure or in case the quality of a set is deemed compromised, the number of sets and the
catch are adjusted accordingly.

GILLNET TEST FISHERIES

Gillnet test fishery CPUE calculations are a bit more complicated as gill net fishing effort (E) calculations
consider the length of the net as well as the length of time the fishing net is in use, i.e., the soak time:

(2)

𝐸 =

𝑁𝑒𝑡 𝐿𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ (𝑓𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑚)× 𝑆𝑜𝑎𝑘 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒
1000

The soak time is calculated as the time the net is entirely in the water, plus half of the time that it takes
to set the net and to retrieve it:

(3)

𝑆𝑜𝑎𝑘 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 = 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 𝑂𝑢𝑡 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 −  𝐹𝑢𝑙𝑙 𝐼𝑛 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒

+

𝐹𝑢𝑙𝑙 𝐼𝑛 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 −  𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 𝐼𝑛 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒
2
𝐹𝑢𝑙𝑙 𝑂𝑢𝑡 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 − 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 𝑂𝑢𝑡 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒
2

+

The CPUE is then calculated by the total number of sockeye caught, divided by fishing effort (equation
1).

The efficiency of salmon gill nets is affected by several technical and biological factors. One such
technical factor, gear saturation, occurs when the gill net loses its efficiency as a greater number of
target individuals are present in the net. In the lower Fraser River gillnet test fisheries, this saturation
results in a reduced catch rate or catchability through either space limitation, or gear avoidance.
Catchability corrections factors are used to adjust the catch rate when the total number of salmon
caught in the gill net is so large that it restricts the catch rate of additional salmon. Historically, a catch
level of 50 total salmon in a single set is thought to be the point where the relationship between total
salmon CPUE and total salmon catch begins to become non-linear, to the extent that a catchability
correction factor should be applied.

When the total salmon catch is larger than 50, the sockeye CPUE is calculated as:

(4)

𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑠𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑦𝑒 = 𝐶𝑠𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑦𝑒 × 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟

The methodology used to calculate a correction factor is the slope of the regression line fitted through
catch and CPUE data of sets with less than 50 salmon caught. Under these conditions, it is believed that
gear saturation is minimal. The total salmon catch is the independent variable and the uncorrected total
salmon CPUE is the dependant variable. When this linear regression is performed, the intercept is forced
to zero. Figure 1 illustrates the derivation of the correction factor for the Whonnock sockeye gillnet test
fishery.

This regression is re-run each year separately for the Whonnock and Cottonwood gillnet test fisheries.
The analysis is performed on a subset of historical data, based on the fisher, the net used, and recency.
Updates to the gill net correction factor are only made when it deviates substantially from other years.
Analyses have not been performed to determine quantitatively the catch level where the relationship
becomes non-linear.

Figure 1. Salmon catch and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in Whonnock gillnet test fishery sets in
the years 2010, 2014, and 2018. The blue line represents a slope of 0.15 and was generated by
running a linear regression on sets where less than 50 salmon were caught. As total salmon catch
increases past 50, the salmon CPUE does not continue to increase linearly. This effect is believed
to be due to gear saturation of the gill net.

TROLL TEST FISHERIES

CPUE in hook and line fisheries are tricky measures to estimate. It is obvious that effort is some function
of time and the amount of gear used, however, once a hook has caught a fish, it is no longer fishing. The
dynamics of the decline in effort of a fishing line with hooks was the subject of a study in 1989 (Cave,
unpublished). It concluded that unbiased measures of CPUE (catch/1000 hook-minutes) were well
related to gross measures of catch, total minutes fished, and average number of hooks per line.
Unbiased sockeye CPUEs was calculated as (Cave 1997):

(5)

𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑠 =

𝐶𝑠
𝐶𝑇

𝑒(𝑖+𝑎1 𝑙𝑛 𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑇+𝑎2(𝑙𝑛 𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑇)2)

Where Cs/CT is the proportion of sockeye (s) in the total catch (CT) and CPUET is the unadjusted all-
species catch-per-unit-effort. The latter is based on the catch of all target and non-target species
including shakers (under-sized juvenile salmonids) and effort in 1000 hook-minutes, calculated as:

(6)

𝐸𝑓𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑡 =

𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑘𝑠 × 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑡𝑒𝑠 𝑓𝑖𝑠ℎ𝑒𝑑
1000

The regression constants are i = 0.123, a1 = 1.012 and a2=0.0746.

The PSC Troll test fishery fishes in six different statistical areas called quadrants. The CPUE for a survey
period is estimated by weighing the CPUE of each quadrant by the proportion (Pq) each quadrant
represents of the survey area:

(7)

𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸 = ∑

𝑞=1→6

(𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑞 × 𝑃𝑞)

The proportions of the total survey area by quadrant are listed in Table 1.

REEF NET TEST FISHERIES

The CPUE in the reef net test fisheries is referred to as counts per minute (C/Min). Fishing effort in the
reef net test fishery is strictly the number of minutes spent counting. There are no adjustments made to
CPUE based on fish abundance or counting conditions.

Planned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement
Under the current workflow, gill net correction factors are calculated pre-season based on historic data
and this correction factor is applied to in-season catches. In the future, it may be beneficial to calculate
season specific correction factors and make in-season adjustments to the daily CPUEs.

B3. In-river Catchability Estimates

S. Wong and M.J. Hague

Summary
Mission hydroacoustic data is the primary source for estimating daily sockeye salmon
abundances in the lower Fraser River. However, in cases when sockeye estimates based on
hydroacoustic data are either (1) unavailable, or (2) unreliable due to dominance of other
salmon species, catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data from the Whonnock test fishery can provide
alternative sockeye passage estimates. However, high variability in the historical Whonnock
expansion line (inverse of the catchability) results in uncertain abundance estimates when
derived from CPUE data. The following report describes the derivation of the historical
expansion line (EL) estimates that can be applied in-season to estimate sockeye passage in the
absence of hydroacoustic assessments (Chapter B18). It also describes the criteria used to
decide when historical expansion lines should be adjusted based on the information observed
in-season.

Introduction
As part of the Pacific Salmon Treaty agreements (PST 2020, Chapter 4), the Fraser River Panel is
responsible for the enumeration of sockeye and pink salmon escapement in the Fraser River.
Traditionally this is done through the collection of hydroacoustic data at Mission, B.C. (Chapter B10). The
resulting total salmon estimates are divided among the species present through the application of
species composition estimates derived from test fishing catches collected by the gillnet test fishery at
Whonnock (Chapter B16). On odd years, when pink salmon are the dominant species (late August -
September) and the uncertainty associated with the species composition is large, sockeye abundance is
instead derived directly from the Whonnock catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) by multiplying this estimate
with an in-river expansion line (1/catchability). In addition, Whonnock CPUE-based abundance estimates
are also used when the Mission hydroacoustic program is not operational, e.g., during high discharge
periods, before the hydroacoustic program has started, or after it has shut down for the season.

CPUE-based abundance estimates rely on catchability estimates which are derived based on historical
observations of CPUE and abundance. It is a well-recognized fact that catchability can vary across a
multitude of factors and rarely displays a linear relationship with fish abundance (Brannian 1982). As
such, Whonnock CPUE-based estimates of sockeye salmon abundance are inherently more uncertain
than hydroacoustic-based estimates. An understanding of the key variables that affect the Whonnock
expansion line is therefore critical to determine what expansion line estimate should be applied to in-
season CPUE data to produce the best abundance estimates and reduce the associated uncertainty. The
following report describes the method used to derive historical sockeye expansion line estimates for the
in-river gillnet test fishery at Whonnock as well as the criteria used to decide when historical expansion
lines should be adjusted based on the information observed in-season.

Data
The primary purpose of the Whonnock gillnet test fishery in the lower Fraser River is to collect species
composition information (Nelitz et al. 2018). When using CPUE data from this test fishery to derive
sockeye abundance, the associated catchability or expansion line (1/catchability) needs to be estimated
based on historical data. Expansion lines are calculated by dividing an estimate of “true” abundance,

75

In-season Assessments: Fisheries Information

such as hydroacoustic-based passage, by test fishery CPUE. For this analysis, historical CPUE data and
hydroacoustic-based sockeye abundance estimates in the lower Fraser River from 2008 to 2020 were
used. The CPUE data were derived by dividing the number of gilled and girthed sockeye salmon by the
fishing effort. The fishing effort in turn was derived by multiplying the length of the fishing net/1000 by
the fishing time, i.e., the time the whole net is in the water plus half of the setting and picking time.

In addition to the Whonnock test fishery data and sockeye abundance estimates, a series of associated
metadata were included in the analyses to evaluate trends, i.e. information about the day, year, and
fishing location (Whonnock Channel or Glenn Valley Bar). Additional covariates were explored to
evaluate their impact on catchability: total catch, sockeye catch, sockeye passage, number of seals,
discharge levels, water temperature and wind direction (Table 1).

For the in-season application of expansion line estimates, the corrected CPUE data from the test fishing
database were used. The correction factor applied to gillnet CPUE data accounts for the saturation
effect. In addition, only days with total gilled, girthed and tangled catch of at least five fish were used to
calculate the historical expansion lines and applied to in-season CPUE data.

Methods
The analysis of the in-river expansion line only included CPUE data for days where at least five sockeye
were caught, to remove the impact of small sample sizes on the uncertainty associated with the
expansion line. To further reduce the impact of the variability in test fishing catches on the analysis,
expansion line estimates had been based on six days of observations, identical to the approach applied
to derive expansion line estimates for marine test fisheries. Therefore, expansion line estimates for a
given day were calculated using total passage and total CPUE over six days, covering three days before
and two days after the day of interest. If a 6-day period contained less than 4 days with sufficient
catches, the estimates for this period were not included in the analysis.

Correlation and trend analyses such as linear regressions (in case of continuous variables) and ANOVAs
(in case of categorical variables) were conducted to identify covariates that could explain a significant
proportion of the historical variance in expansion lines with the aim to improve in-season predictions.
Because of the noted temporal trend in the expansion line estimates across the season, additional cross
correlation analyses were conducted for the other covariables that removed the effect of the day of the
year on the expansion line. Because the change in expansion line across the season is not necessarily
linear, the expansion line data were also summarized by calculating the mean expansion line over a
period of two weeks based on the geometric means of the daily estimates across subsets of years. This
allowed to assess trends across all years, all years excluding the 2018 cycle line, by cycle line, even years
only, and odd years only.

Results
There is a high degree of variability in historical expansion lines – with values based on 6 days of data
ranging from 558 to 109,978 after the catch threshold of ≥ 5 sockeye salmon was applied (Figure 1).
Regressions between expansion line and day demonstrated a positive correlation (R2=0.28, p-value <
0.001), with expansion line increasing throughout the season (Figure 1B). This trend was consistent
across years, with greater variation in expansion lines within than between years (Figure 1). In addition
to the temporal trend, significant correlations were noted for several covariates: sockeye passage, total
catch, discharge, fishing location, sockeye catch and water temperature, even though the correlation for
the latter two were very low, with an R2 of 0.09 and 0.03, respectively. The differences in expansion lines
between fishing location was significant but this was mainly due to differences in discharge as the test
fishery was most often in operation at Glen Valley Bar during periods of high discharge earlier in the

76

season. Year, seal presence and wind direction were unable to explain the variation in expansion lines.
In the case of seal predation, this could be due to the uncertainty in the seal data, which are based on
visual observations from the observer aboard the test fishing vessel.

Alternatively, multiple regression models with interactions between day or discharge, and catch,
passage or water temperature generally explained more variation in the expansion line data than
models without the interaction term. The two co-variates which explained the greatest percentage of
the historical variability in Whonnock expansion line were day and sockeye passage past Mission (Table
1). Given that expansion lines are derived based on total sockeye abundance, it makes sense that
sockeye passage explained a lot of the variation in expansion line, but it would not be possible to utilise
this variable in-season as typically CPUE-based abundance estimates are needed in-season when
hydroacoustic-based sockeye abundances are not available or unreliable. Day of the year is a good proxy
for abundance, with abundances being low for Early Stuart and increasing later in the season when
Summer-run and Late-run sockeye enter in the river. This explains the significant correlation of the
expansion line with day.

The pattern in abundance is not consistent across years but differs by cycle line, with the dominant 2018
cycle line seeing a sharper increase in sockeye abundance compared to other cycle line years when
later-timed Early Summer-run sockeye enter into the river. On 2020 cycle line years, overall abundance
trends downward faster compared to other years, while on odd cycle line years it is the increase in pink
abundance later in the season that increases overall salmon abundance. Summarising the historical
expansion line data for two-week periods shows a stepwise increase in expansion lines across the
season (Table 2) that fits well to the observations across all years (Figure 2). Across cycle lines, the 2018
cycle line shows an increase in expansion line in the beginning of August while on odd years, this
increase only occurs in September when pink salmon increase overall salmon abundance in the river. In
comparison, on 2020 cycle years, most of the run would have already migrated past Mission at the start
of September.

6-day expansion lines across various year subsets, i.e., all years, odd years, even years, all years
excluding 2018 cycle line, 2018 cycle line. The geometric means of the 6-day expansion lines
across all years are presented as grey dots. Historical expansion lines were calculated using
corrected CPUE data from the test-fishing database for days with at least 5 salmon caught.

IN-SEASON APPLICATION

In absence of other sources of in-season information, the historical expansion line estimates (Table 2,
Figure 2) can be applied directly to corrected Whonnock CPUE data. Given the limited historical data
available early in the season, averages should be calculated across all years until July 15th (Figure 3).
Later in the season, the expansion line applied may vary by cycle year and depend on the
correspondence of the historical expansion lines with the expansion line observed in-season. In case the
historical expansion line deviates substantially with the in-season estimates (for periods dominated by
sockeye salmon when such comparisons can be made), the average ratio between observed and
historical expansion lines can be used to rescale the historical expansion line up or down for the
remainder of the season. This approach both adjusts for in-season conditions while still accounting for
historical patterns of seasonality. Given the high variability in CPUE based abundance estimates, the
implied species composition estimate should continuously be monitored and compared to other
observations of species composition to ensure resulting sockeye abundance estimates fall within
realistic ranges. A full overview of the decisions in terms of in-season expansion line estimates can be
found in Figure 3.

Planned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement
Current results are based on a limited dataset that only includes 2008-2020. Data are especially limited
at the start and the end of the season, especially on non-dominant years (years excluding the 2018
cycle). This especially impacts sockeye abundance estimates on odd years when pink salmon are in the
river as the assumed expansion line will have been mainly derived from data collected when no pinks
were in the river and when Late-run stocks were dominating sockeye abundance. The potential bias this
may create should be examined. In addition, while the two-week periods generally match the pattern of
increasing expansion line well throughout the season, resulting abundance estimates are more likely to
be biased around the time of the step increase. The impacts of using a stepped method rather than a
linear increase could be further investigated. Finally, knowledge from fishers suggests that both water
clarity and fish size impact catchability and thus could potentially aid in exposing patterns in expansion
lines.

B4. Marine Catchability Estimates

C.G.J. Michielsens

Summary
In-season run size assessments for Fraser River sockeye salmon rely on estimates of daily
abundance (Chapter B18). The most seaward daily abundance estimates come from marine test
fisheries in Johnstone Strait (Area 12) and Juan de Fuca Strait (Area 20). The catch-per-unit-
effort (CPUE) data from these test fisheries (Chapter B2) can be used in combination with an
expansion line estimate (inverse catchability) to derive daily abundances. At the start of the
season, a historical expansion line estimate is applied, derived from data for past years. Due to
the high variability in expansion lines, both between years and within a season, the predicted
abundances based on CPUE data used in combination with historical expansion lines may
deviate substantially from reconstructed abundances based on Mission hydroacoustic data and
seaward catch. Predicted abundance estimates can be improved if the expansion line is
updated using in-season observations. The following report provides an overview of the
evaluation of different historical and in-season expansion line estimates for marine gillnet and
purse seine test fisheries.

Introduction
As part of the Pacific Salmon Treaty agreements (PST 2020, Chapter 4), the Fraser River Panel is
responsible for conducting test fisheries on Fraser River sockeye salmon. Test fishery data include catch-
per-unit-effort (CPUE) data, species composition and stock identification, and other biological metrics
such as length, weight, and age. The CPUE data is a relative index that, when multiplied by an expansion
line (inverse catchability), provides an estimate of daily abundance. There is a minimum 6-day lag before
CPUE-based abundances can be aligned with reconstructed estimates derived from hydroacoustic data
due to the travel time between marine test fishing locations and the lower Fraser River hydroacoustic
site located near Mission, B.C. (Michielsens and Cave 2018). But while CPUE-based abundances provide
more timely estimates, they are less accurate than reconstructed values due to the high degree of
uncertainty in the associated expansion line. Early in-season, the expansion lines are based on historical
data, but once there is sufficient overlap between CPUE-based and reconstructed timeseries, these
estimates can be updated with in-season observations.

Early in-season, gillnet test fishing vessels are used to assess Early Stuart and Early Summer-run sockeye
while purse seine data are traditionally used to assess Summer-run and Late-run stocks, and later-timed
components of the Early Summer run (Nelitz et al. 2018). While the gillnet test fishery costs less to
operate, the catchability is too low and uncertain to derive reliable abundance estimates for Summer-
run and Late-run stocks. In Johnstone Strait, the Area 12 gillnet test fishery occurs at Round Island. Due
to safety considerations, two gillnet vessels are used to assess abundance in the Area 20 of Juan de Fuca
Strait. It is assumed to take 8 and 6 days, respectively, for sockeye observed in these gillnet test fisheries
to reach the Mission hydroacoustic site. Traditionally, the primary purse seine test fishery in Johnstone
Strait takes place in Area 12 (7 days seaward of Mission), but Area 13 (6 days seaward of Mission) offers
an alternative test fishing location with a potentially higher catchability due to the narrower size of the
Strait there. In Juan de Fuca strait, salmon encountered by the purse seine fishery in Area 20 take about
6 days to migrate to the Mission hydroacoustic site.

Data
Expansion line analyses relied on daily CPUE data from both purse seine and gillnet test fishing vessels
(Chapter B1) and daily reconstructed abundances based on Mission hydroacoustic estimates plus
seaward catches (Chapter B18). Expansion line estimates were evaluated using data from 1998 to 2014.
To reduce the impact of the variability in test fishing catches on the analyses, in-season expansion line
estimates were based on six days of observations. A total of 524 matched Area 12 and Area 20 daily gill
net CPUE estimates, 642 matched Area 12 and Area 20 purse seine CPUE estimates, and 602 matched
Area 13 and Area 20 purse seine CPUE estimates were analyzed. To evaluate density dependence, total
catch data for both sockeye and pink salmon were also included in the analyses. Sockeye stocks that
delay their upriver migration by holding in the Strait of Georgia, such as Late run and Harrison stocks
(Lapointe et al. 2003), were analyzed separately given that the variable delay and redistribution in the
Gulf violates the “boxcar” migration assumptions required for run reconstructions (Cave and Gazey
1996).

Figure 1. Boxplot of 6-day gillnet and purse seine expansion line estimates across the season
(1998 to 2014). Gill net estimates relate to Early Stuart, Early Summer-run and Summer-run
stocks excluding Harrison while purse seine estimates relate to Summer-run excluding Harrison
stocks. The high purse seine expansion lines in September are associated with low marine
abundances.

Methods
Optimizing the in-season application of expansion line (inverse catchability) estimates to daily CPUE data
requires decision rules which have been obtained through retrospective analyses that evaluate the
accuracy of different marine expansion line strategies to predict abundances at Mission 6 to 8 days later
(Table 1). Due to time-varying trends (Figure 1) and density-dependent effects on catchability, simply
applying the lagged observed expansion line values may not provide the best estimates. In addition,
because in-season daily catchabilities cannot be calculated for delaying stocks, the validity of catchability
estimates derived from other stock components must be assessed.

Using the data from 1998 to 2014, retrospective analyses for different expansion line strategies (Table 1)
were performed by predicting the total annual abundances for a given stock group (𝑁𝑦̂ ) and comparing
this to the observed total abundances (𝑁𝑦). The bias (i.e. mean percent error, MPE), and precision (i.e.
mean absolute percent error, MAPE) of the predicted annual abundances were calculated using:

where 𝑁𝑦̂  is the predicted total annual abundance, derived from the daily Johnstone Strait (A12 or 13)
and Juan de Fuca Strait (A20) CPUE data and the expansion line (1/catchability, q):

.

When using Area 13 purse seine data, catches seaward of the Area 13 purse seine test fishery
(𝐶𝑦,𝑑,𝑆𝑒𝑎𝐴13) are added to predict the abundance in Area 12.

𝑁𝑦̂ = ∑ (

For gillnet (GN) test fisheries, it was assumed that the sockeye catchability is the same in both test
fisheries:

(5)

𝑞𝐺𝑁,𝐴20=𝑞𝐺𝑁,𝐴12.

The relative catchability of the different purse seine test fisheries was assumed to be related to the
relative width of the area swept or sampled, i.e., the width of the migratory channel at the test fishing
site in relation to the size of the fishing net. Because the relative width of the area swept in Johnstone
Straight is 2.2 times larger than in Juan de Fuca Strait, it is assumed that the sockeye catchability of the
purse seine test fishery in Area 12 is 2.2 times greater than in Area 20:

(6)

qPS,A12=2.2  ∙ qPS,A20.

Similarly, the catchability in Area 13 is assumed to be 1.5 times greater than the in Area 12:

(7)

qPS,A13=1.5  ∙ qPS,A12.

Because the catchabilities of the different fisheries are assumed to be related, often only Area 20
expansion lines are reported (1/𝑞𝑦,𝑑,𝐴20).

Table 1 provides an overview of the main in-season expansion line strategies for the different stock
groups and test fisheries that have been evaluated to determine the optimal approach for estimating
𝑞𝑦,𝑑,𝐴20. Performance of the strategies was evaluated for different subsets of years: (1) all years, (2)
recent 8 years since 2007, (3) high and low abundance years, (4) pink salmon (odd) years, and (5) by
cycle line. In addition to the main strategies, additional strategies evaluated the length of days on which
to base the in-season expansion line (6 days versus 1 days, 3 days, all dates to date) and the size of the
adjustment to the expansion line. An expansion line strategy that relied on 6 days of in-season data for
example would rely on daily reconstructed abundances and CPUE data observed 7 to 12 days prior
because it takes an additional 6 days to travel from the marine test fishing locations to the lower Fraser
River hydroacoustic site. The resulting Area 20 in-season expansion line is calculated as follows:

.

Adjustments to in-season expansion lines allowed to account for time-varying trends across the season
and density-dependent effects. Adjustments had been implemented either by multiplying the in-season
expansion line for Area 20 (1/𝑞𝑦,𝑑,𝐴20) with the adjustment or by adding or subtracting the adjustment.

Comparing performance using total abundance instead of daily estimates reduced the susceptibility of
the analyses to violations in migration speed assumptions and reduced the weight of low abundance
days while also increasing the importance of high abundance days. In addition, comparing total
estimates allowed the same performance measures to be used to assess the expansion lines for delaying
Late-run and Harrison stocks.

Results
Using gillnet test fishery data, if the gradual increase in the historical expansion line is accounted for, the
resulting run size estimates for Early Stuart, Early Summer and Summer run excluding Harrison are
unbiased (Figure 2, a1, strategy 1) but the estimates will not be very precise (Figure 2, b1). Using an in-
season expansion line increases the precision, but due to the lag in updating the observations, the
resulting abundance estimates are biased low (Figure 2, a1 and b1, strategy 2). The bias can be
corrected on average by multiplying the observed expansion line with a factor of 1.25 to account for the
increasing trend (Figure 2, a1 and b1, strategy 3). Further improvements can be made by adjusting the
expansion line depending on total daily catch, with smaller catch days requiring larger adjustments
compared to larger catch days (Figure 2, a1 and b1, strategy 4, Table 2). When restricting the data to
recent years, results are similar but slightly more pronounced (Figure 2, a2 and b2). Applying the same
gill net expansion lines from non-Harrison stocks to estimate daily abundances for Harrison results in
abundances that are too low, even if in-season adjusted expansion line estimates are used (Figure 1, a3).
Assuming the expansion line for Harrison is double the expansion line for other stocks removes the bias
and improves the precision of the daily estimates (Figure 2, a3, b3).

For purse seine test fishery data (Figure 3), in-season expansion lines are more precise than historical
expansion estimates but, in the case of Summer run excluding Harrison, may slightly overestimate
abundance unless the in-season expansion line is reduced (Figure 3, a1 and b1). Abundance estimates
can be improved by adjusting the expansion line depending on total catch, with larger catch days
requiring bigger downward adjustments (Table 2). Adjusting expansion lines of individual fishing sets
does not seem to further improve abundance estimates. For Harrison sockeye, the best expansion line
strategy relies on the in-season expansion line for Summer run excluding Harrison without adjustments
(Figure 3, a2 and b2). For Late-run sockeye, the best strategy is also to rely on in-season expansion lines
for Summer run but to adjust them based on total catch (Figure 3, a3 and b3). Using an historical
expansion line of 230 for Late run results in unbiased but imprecise total run size estimates. A full
overview of the recommended expansion line strategies is provided in Table 2.

B5. Sampling Protocol

A.M. Phung and D. Brkic

Summary
This report reviews the sampling protocol relevant to in-season assessments of sockeye salmon.
DNA and scale samples are collected regularly from test fisheries, and opportunistically from
commercial fisheries as fisheries occur. This sampling design is intended to provide up-to-date
stock identification data for in-season Fraser River Panel (FRP) meetings which occur twice a
week. Depending on the test fishery, it typically takes between 2 and 5 days from when a fish is
caught and sampled to when the data are available at FRP meetings. The delay is affected by
the geographic location of the fishery, the availability of shipping services, and how samples for
various fisheries are prioritized depending on changing management needs. Commercial
samples are obtained at fish plants. When sampling, one scale sample and one DNA sample are
collected per fish and stored respectively in a scale book and on Whatman filter sheets.  Scale
samples are shipped to the Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) Secretariat office where they are
read, and the metadata is stored in a database. The DNA is shipped to the Pacific Biological
Station for analysis. Once the DNA has been analyzed, the data are further processed by the
stock identification biologists at the PSC Secretariat office.

Introduction
During the in-season period, the Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) operates a suite of test fisheries along
the northern (Johnstone Strait) and southern (Juan de Fuca Strait) approaches and in the lower Fraser
River (Chapter B1) to obtain an index of sockeye and pink abundance throughout their migration
towards Mission (Chapter B18). DNA (Chapter B9) and scale (Chapter B7) samples collected from catches
in marine test fisheries give an early indication of the ages and stock composition of salmon that are
returning to the Fraser River. In addition to age of fish, scale samples provide information on growth
rate and can potentially be used to determine the stock of origin. Lengths and weights of fish are also
often recorded in test fishery and commercial fishery sampling (Chapter B6).

In addition to sampling of test fishing catches, commercial catches are also sampled in-season. The main
objective of the commercial catch sampling program is to gather information from DNA samples, scale
samples, and biological data in order to estimate stock composition of the total commercial catch. In
comparison to test fisheries, which generally collect information on sockeye migration (i.e., all of the
sockeye in an area at a given time), commercial fisheries are sampled with a focus on estimating
catches. The number and magnitude of commercial fishery openings vary from year to year depending
on sockeye run size. When run sizes are high, the large number of samples obtained from commercial
fisheries may provide better representation of the sockeye catch than test fisheries. The information
from commercial catch samples is used to help determine the relative exploitation of each of the Fraser
River sockeye management groups within a commercial fishery opening. This information can also
contribute to run-size assessments, especially when used complementary to data from the test fisheries.

During Canadian commercial fisheries openings, processing plants in the vicinities of Nanaimo and
Vancouver are targeted for sampling landings. For commercial openings in northwest Washington State,
processing plants in Bellingham are primarily targeted to sample landed catches.

SAMPLING DESIGN

Test Fisheries
The goal of sampling test fishery catches is to provide the most up-to-date stock composition
information during in-season Fraser River Panel (FRP) meetings which occur on Tuesdays and Fridays.
The geographic location of test fisheries coupled with limitations in air carrier services can lead to delays
in data flow in-season. When fish are caught in Area 12 test fisheries, samples can take three (in the
case of purse seine catch) to five (for gillnet catch) days until the stock composition data are available to
be presented at the Friday FRP meetings. For the Tuesday FRP meeting, it can take three to four days
after fish are caught to obtain Area 12 gillnet data and Area 12 purse seine data, respectively. When fish
are caught in Area 20 test fisheries, samples can take two (purse seine) to three (gillnet) days until the
data are available to be presented at the Tuesday or Friday Panel meeting. Purse seine samples are
generally prioritized over gillnet samples as purse seine samples are considered to be more
representative of the true population. This is because gill nets are believed to be selective towards
certain stocks and fish that swim closer to the surface (Šmejkal et al. 2015), and because of size-
selectivity imposed by the mesh size. The sampling schedule for collecting biological information varies
depending on the test fishery. Table 1 shows the sampling schedule for 2018 and lists the target daily
sample sizes for each test fishery. A sample consists of one DNA tissue “punch” (obtained using a one-
hole punch on the adipose fin), one scale, and biological data including length, weight, and sex (Chapter
B6). The schedule and sample sizes may vary between years depending on shipping logistics and size of
the catch.

Commercial Fisheries
Commercial fishery samples are collected opportunistically as fisheries occur. Generally, the target for a
sampling trip is to collect 100 samples from each commercial fishery opening by gear type and key
statistical area if fish are caught. This usually results in about 200-300 samples per sampling trip. Some
commercial fisheries are sampled more intensively than others depending on catch numbers, logistics,
and utility of the collected information at the time to the FRP meeting. When sampling purse seine
commercial fishery catches, ideally more than 100 samples would be collected per area as catches tend
to be higher than for other gear types. Unlike test fisheries which follow a strict sample collection
schedule outlined pre-season, samples for commercial fisheries are more challenging to plan for due to
uncertainty around where and when catches are going to be landed. Table 2 provides a summary of
guidelines for sampling frequency during a year with ample available TAC such as 2018. Canadian
commercial catches from Areas B, D, E and H are sampled at fish plants in Vancouver while catches from
Areas B, D, G and H are sampled at fish plants in Nanaimo. US commercial catches in Areas 7 and 7A are
sampled at fish plants in Bellingham. In-season communication with fish plant representatives is crucial
to planning sampling trips to maximize the amount of information that can be obtained.

When catches are large, commercial sampling may include ratio counts. Ratio counts involve estimating
the proportion of rare, visually identifiable fish types (e.g., adipose-clipped fish and/or jacks) to other
fish within the catch and includes additional targeted sampling of those fish. Jacks may be an indicator
of abundance for the following years, while sampling adipose-clipped fish is used to assess stocks of
interest more precisely such as the Cultus Lake sockeye stock.

Table 2. Sampling frequency guidelines for commercial fisheries by key statistical area in a high
TAC year. Sampling frequency describes the number of sampling trips, not the total number of
samples collected.  Most sampling trips involve the collection of two or three sample sets of 100
fish from multiple statistical areas.

Methods
The protocol for collecting DNA and scale samples and biological information is the same for both test
fishery and commercial fisheries. Samplers distinguish sockeye from other salmon species by following
guidelines outlined in the Sampling Manuals for test fishing observers and port samplers. Scale samples,
DNA samples, and/or biological data, such as fish length, weight, and sex are collected on the boat, after
landing, or at a processing plant. DNA, scales and biological data are primarily collected as “matched
samples”, meaning each piece of information can be traced back to the same fish. This permits
comparisons of age, size, sex, and growth between and within stocks. In some instances, there are scale
samples taken without associated DNA or biological information (Table 1). This “scale-only” sampling is
performed because there are limitations in how many DNA samples can be analyzed due to costs and
efforts needed to collect, analyze and process these samples. For commercial sampling, time is a limiting
factor and sampling information is triaged. DNA has the highest priority, followed by scales, lengths,
sexes, and finally weights. If time is a limiting factor due to scheduled fish plant operations, samplers
may opt to exclude lower-priority information from the collection.

91

In-season Assessments: Biological Information

Scale samples are placed in a scale book along with all the biological data from that individual salmon
and the DNA sample number. The “preferred scale” is selected from each salmon unless it is missing or
damaged and is located on the left side of the salmon, on the second scale row above the lateral line in
a diagonal line from the posterior of the dorsal fin to the anterior of the anal fin (Figure 2). If the
preferred scale is missing, the next closest scale is taken as long as it is at least two scale rows above the
lateral line and behind the front of the dorsal fin. Scales higher than four scale rows above the lateral
line may be sampled in rare cases if all scales near the preferred scale location are missing. This is
because the characteristics of the scales on a sockeye vary dorso-ventrally (top to bottom). In this case,
the sampler notes that a non-preferred scale was used. If there are no usable scales on the left side of
the fish, a right-side scale may be used, but the sampler must take note of this because it can affect how
the scale is read. If neither side of the fish has appropriate scales to sample, the sampler should pick
another fish if there is an adequate number of fish to sample.

Figure 2. The preferred location of the scale to sample. Scales higher than four scale rows above
the lateral line are non-preferred.

DNA samples are collected by using a one-hole punch and punching one small, thin disk from the margin
of the adipose fin of the salmon. If the adipose fin is missing, a caudal fin clip is taken instead. While the
sample is still wet, the DNA is placed on a Whatman sheet. The alternative storage of DNA in ethanol
vials is less desirable but is used in cases where Whatman paper is not available or if heavy wind and/or
rain make using Whatman sheets difficult. To prevent contamination, sampling equipment is rinsed after
each sample is taken.

The procedures to gather biological data such as length, weight, and sex, are described in Chapter B6.
Ratio counts are determined by dividing the total number of jacks or adipose-clipped fish encountered
by the total number of fish counted. To conduct ratio counts in a fish plant, the number of fish without
an adipose fin is counted as fish pass by on a conveyor belt as they are being off-loaded. DNA and scale
samples as well as biological information are collected for jacks and fish missing their adipose fin
(adipose-clipped or adipose-damaged).

92

In-season Assessments: Biological Information

Scale samples are analyzed at the Scale Lab within the PSC Secretariat office in Downtown Vancouver.
DNA samples are analyzed by the Molecular Genetics Lab at the Pacific Biological Station (PBS) in
Nanaimo. For the Johnstone Strait test fisheries, test fishing observers drop off biological samples at an
air carrier service to be shipped as soon as possible to Vancouver. For the Area 20 Juan de Fuca test
fisheries, the test-fishing observer delivers biological samples to a contractor in Port Renfrew who drives
the samples to AC Taxi in Nanaimo in the evening. In the morning, AC Taxi delivers the DNA samples to
PBS and the scale samples to an air carrier service. The samples are picked up from the air carrier service
in Vancouver by PSC staff. In-river DNA samples from Cottonwood and Whonnock are also flown to PBS
for analysis.

B6. Length, Weight, and Sex

D. Brkic and A.M. Phung

Summary
Biological information of salmon collected by the Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) includes
length, weight, and sex information. Length measurements are used to supplement stock
identification information (Chapter B9) and as inputs into models that differentiate fish species
based on hydroacoustic lengths, i.e., length-based mixture models (Chapter B16). Weights in
combination with lengths are important for understanding fish condition but also provide the
fishing industry with information on the potential value of expected catches. Sex information is
equally important as analyses of lengths and weights often requires separation of the sexes.
Lengths are measured and recorded in terms of fork length, postorbital fork length (POF), and
postorbital hypural length (POH). Length measurements are taken using a “POF stick” while
weights are measured using industrial scales. Sex is determined by making an incision in the
abdomen and inspecting the gonads by touch.

Introduction
The Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) collects and stores biological information – including length,
weight, and sex – from salmon sampled from commercial and test fishery catches. Differences in
average historical length between fish stocks may be used during stock identification to help resolve
uncertain stock assignment (Chapter B9). Fish lengths also help distinguish different species within a
mixture of different length estimates obtained from hydroacoustic data (Chapter B16). Multi-year
records of length and weight may reveal deviations from average, which could be important in fisheries
planning as larger fish are more valuable both in terms of catch and in terms of brood stock.
Determining the sex of sampled fish is important as morphological differences between the sexes may
lead to differential catchability in fishing gears as well as varying offload weights when fish are sold.
Analyses done on length and weight data also generally require separation of the sexes.

LENGTH DEFINITIONS

The Pacific Salmon Commission collects three different types of length measurements: fork length,
postorbital fork length (POF), and postorbital hypural length (POH). Figure 1 shows the difference
between fork length, POF, and POH.

Postorbital Fork Length

Fork Length

Figure 1. Illustration of the different salmon length measures recorded by the PSC.

Fork length is the length from the anterior-most part of the fish to the posterior end of the middle
caudal rays. Fork length is best used to determine the overall size of a fish when it has deeply forked
tails and difficult-to-distinguish hypural plates as is the case for salmon. The PSC uses fork lengths in the
hydroacoustic length-based mixture models.

The postorbital fork (POF) length measures the length from the posterior of the orbit (the back of the
eye) to the posterior end of the middle caudal rays. Excluding the snout of the fish in the measurement
helps circumvent the impact of highly variable snout lengths, as male salmon tend to develop distinct
hooked snouts during maturation. The PSC sometimes uses POF to supplement stock identification
information based on scales and DNA. POF is also used to track changes in length-at-age across return
years.

The postorbital hypural (POH) length is the length from the posterior of the orbit to the hypural notch.
This length measure is especially used during sampling on the spawning ground when the caudal fins
tend to degrade, especially among females, causing the POF to become highly variable. Both the orbit
and hypural north, used to determine the POH, can be identified on even highly degraded carcases. The
PSC uses POH during sampling on spawning grounds as well as during in-river test fishery sampling. This
allows comparing the POH of the test fishery samples against spawning ground samples.

Other types of fish lengths include mid-eye fork length (MEF) and standard length. These lengths are
generally not taken by the PSC but are entered into the PSC’s scale database when samples are received
from other organizations. MEF is the length from the middle of the orbit to the fork in the tail. MEF
length is generally taken in fishery samples by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Standard length
is the length from the tip of the snout to the hypural notch and is generally taken for spawning ground
samples by Fisheries and Oceans Canada.

SAMPLING DESIGN

There are five main types of biological data collected in the field by the PSC: fork length, POF, POH,
weight, and sex. Tables 1 to 3 show which lengths are taken at each fishery, whether weights are taken,
and the sample sizes for lengths and weights.

Fork lengths are generally only measured at the Whonnock gillnet test fishery and the Cottonwood
gillnet test fishery. Fork lengths are measured for sockeye, pink, chum, Chinook, and unreleased (dead)
coho salmon. Fork lengths are not measured for steelhead and released (live) coho. Forks lengths from
Whonnock and Cottonwood are typically used within hydroacoustic length-based mixture models. If
there are insufficient fork length samples available from Whonnock and Cottonwood, additional fork
lengths data may be required from other test fisheries or commercial fisheries.

95

In-season Assessments: Biological Information

Postorbital fork (POF) lengths are measured at all PSC test fisheries and when commercial fisheries are
sampled. POF is only measured for sockeye and pink salmon. For commercial fisheries and reef net test
fisheries, sample sizes for length are determined by catch sizes and DNA sample requirements. Every
fish sampled for DNA has an associated POF measurement unless the samplers are facing extreme time
limitations at fish plants.

Postorbital hypural (POH) lengths are the primary length measurements for spawning grounds samples.
At the Cottonwood and Whonnock test fisheries, POH is measured for all sampled sockeye, adipose-
clipped Chinook, and coho salmon. At Whonnock, POH lengths are also measured for pink salmon.

Weights of individual fish are measured only for sockeye and pink salmon and only at the Cottonwood,
Whonnock, Area 20 GN, Area 20 PS, Area 4B/5 GN, Qualark GN, and Area 7 RN test fisheries. Individual
weights are also measured for commercial fishery samples. Weights are not measured for individuals
that are incomplete such as fish that are damaged by seals or dressed. For commercial samples,
individual weights may not be measured if time is a limiting factor. Bulk weights, which is the net weight
of a tote, may also be recorded and are used to calculate the average weight. For Chinook, chum, and
coho caught at test fisheries, only bulk weights are recorded when the fish are sold.

Sexes are recorded for all sampled sockeye and pink salmon whenever possible. For commercial
samples, sexes may not be determined if time is limiting.

Methods
All lengths are measured using a “POF Stick”: a custom-made 1-meter aluminum ruler with one fixed
post at the zero marker and one sliding post. The posts are 6-7cm long and generally have a fine-pointed
tip. The accuracy of POF sticks is tested by setting the POF stick measurement to 50cm, then measuring
from the inner edge of the fixed post to the point of the sliding post using measuring tape or another
ruler (Figure 2). Lengths are recorded in centimeters or millimeters and are rounded to the nearest
millimeter.

Figure 2. A POF stick and how it can be used to measure lengths. Lengths are measured from the
front of the fixed post to the point of the sliding post

Fork lengths are measured by placing the inner end of the fixed post of the POF stick in front of the fish
snout and moving the point of the sliding post to the fork in the tail. Fork length is not measured if
damage to the snout or tail prevents an accurate reading.

97

In-season Assessments: Biological Information

Postorbital fork (POF) lengths are measured by placing the fixed post of the POF stick into one of the eye
sockets of the fish. The point of the sliding post is then moved to the fork in the tail. POF lengths are not
taken if damage to the eye sockets or tail prevents an accurate reading.

Postorbital hypural (POH) lengths can be measured in three different ways. For the first method, the
flesh covering the hypural plate is cut away with a knife to reveal the hypural notch. The fixed post of
the POF stick is then inserted into the eye socket and the sliding post is pointed at the hypural notch.
This is the preferred method for spawning grounds sampling as it is the most accurate. For the second
method, the sampler feels the tail of the fish to estimate the location of the hypural notch. The hypural
plate is distinctly elevated at the base of the caudal fin rays. The measurement is taken from the eye
socket to the estimated position of the hypural notch. This method is preferred for test fishery sampling
as it is the most time-efficient and does not damage the fish and reduce retail value. The third method
involves folding over the rays of the caudal fin until it can no longer be bent. The measurement can then
be taken from the eye socket to the position of the final bend. This method is another time-efficient
alternative to the first method but is less accurate.

Weights are measured using a Kilotech industrial dial scale or an AND SK-WP digital scale. Scales are
calibrated using two known weights: 1.390kg and 3.915kg. Weights are recorded either in pounds or
kilograms and are always rounded to one decimal place. Average weight is calculated by dividing the
total weight of fish in a sample by the sample size. If bulk weight was recorded, the average is calculated
by dividing the net weight of a tote by the number of fish in it.

To determine the sex of a fish, a cut is made in the belly approximately two inches long from between
where the pectoral fins originate and along the midline of the stomach. The sampler inserts their finger
into the cut until the spine is reached, feeling along the outside of the internal organs. If the fish is
female, the lumpy texture of the egg-filled ovaries can be felt. If the fish is male, the smooth testes can
be felt. If the sampler is inexperienced or if the sex is indistinguishable by feel, the cut in the belly can be
extended further to the posterior and the body cavity opened for a visual examination. For spawning
grounds samples, the sex can be determined by visual examination of exterior morphology, but the body
cavities of females are still examined to evaluate egg deposition or success of spawn.

Planned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement
Erroneous or anomalous length and weight measurements can enter the database unnoticed despite
some existing preventative measures. An error-checking tool is under development to detect outliers in
length-weight data so errors can be caught and rectified earlier. If the source of an error cannot be
identified or if it can’t be fixed, anomalous data can be flagged and subsequently excluded from analysis
if desired. Obvious errors can be removed, such as when fork lengths are shorter than POF lengths. The
tool can also track data accuracy by fishery, allowing fishery-specific sources of errors to be addressed.

B7. In-Season Scale and Age Reading Methods

J.E. Sellars and M.R. Forrest

Summary
Fraser sockeye salmon stocks are managed by four management groups: Early Stuart, Early
Summer run, Summer run and Late run. This stipulation within the Pacific Salmon Treaty
requires salmon run size, catches and escapement estimates to be split into these four groups
using stock composition estimates. In-season, stock composition estimates are derived from
catch samples through scale reading i.e., by analysing scale characteristics and growth patterns
and comparing the resulting patterns against the patterns of salmon with known stock origin.
While DNA-based stock identification (Chapter B9) replaced scale-based methods as the
primary method in 2002, scale-based methods still have an important role in the assessment
for Fraser River sockeye salmon: they provide stock-ID information earlier and when DNA
estimates are not available and they provide additional information to refine DNA-based stock
proportions. In addition to providing stock-ID data, scales are the primary method to assess fish
age. Since the majority of Fraser sockeye return as four-year olds, the portion of age four
compared to age five sockeye is an important indicator to evaluate the strength of the sockeye
run in relation to the strength of the run in the previous year. High age five proportions in-
season may indicate that returns are less favorable than the previous year.

Introduction
It was Dr. C.H. Gilbert, who in the early 1900s, first recognized that the freshwater scale patterns of
Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks differ (Henry 1961) as they reflect unique variations in growth
patterns that develop while stocks are spatially isolated, such as during juvenile residence in lakes or
streams, or during certain phases of marine residence (Gable and Cox-Rogers 1993). In addition, it is also
possible that genetic differences between stocks play a role in observed scale pattern differences (Gable
and Cox-Rogers 1993).

Sockeye salmon scales contain a permanent record of the life history of a fish beginning with the early
fry stage. As the fish grow in body size, corresponding radial scale growth takes place. New basal plates
are formed under existing plates and hyalodentine ridges (circuli) are deposited on the margins between
adjoining plates. The circuli appear under magnification as partially concentric rings which radiate
outward from the scale focus (Figure 1, Gable and Cox-Rogers 1993). Widely spaced bands of circuli
reflect rapid growth in the summer, and compactly spaced bands of circuli growth reflect growth in the
winter (Bilton and Ludwig 1966). Scales contain two distinct zones of scale growth: the freshwater zone,
consisting of thin, narrowly spaced circuli, and an outer marine zone, consisting of thick, widely spaced
circuli (Figure 1). A third zone lies between the freshwater and marine scale zone. This is the “spring
growth” or “plus-growth” zone. Circuli in this zone are of intermediate size and form just prior to, or
soon after, ocean entry. Circuli counts in the freshwater and spring growth zones as well as distance
measures within these zones are used by the PSC for stock identification and to evaluate the rate of
growth in freshwater in a given year.

Data
In-season scale samples are collected regularly from test fisheries, and opportunistically from
commercial fisheries as fisheries occur. For each sockeye sampled, one scale is collected, stored in a
scale book and shipped to the Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) Secretariat office. The PSC scale lab
reads the scales and archives the associated information in a database together with other relevant
information collected during the sampling process. The associated metadata can be used to match scale
information of individual fish with DNA results as well as biological and fisheries information collected in
the field. The PSC scale database contains records dating back to 1912. Initially only spawning ground
scale samples were represented but since 1977 commercial and test fishing scale samples have also
been collected and stored in the database. In addition to the adult scale information, the database also
contains smolt scale information from 1948 to present. Since 1991, the lab analyses between 15,000-
51,000 sockeye scales annually, both for freshwater growth patterns as well as age.

Methods
Scales are forwarded to the PSC scale lab from multiple temporal and spatial locations in scale books.
Each scale is removed from the scale book and cleaned before mounting onto a gummi card. Heat and
pressure using a hydraulic press are used to make an impression of the scales on to a clear sheet of
acetate. It is the microscopic image of the scale impression on the acetate that is used for scale aging
and analysis. Using a microscope connected to a camera and computer, the image of the scale is
captured, stored and analyzed using Image-pro premier software and the resulting scale measurements
are stored in an Excel spreadsheet (Batchelor 2016).

Using expertise and experience, in combination with the image software, the scale analyst will examine
and document the condition of the scale using condition codes (Table 1) and documents the circuli
count of the freshwater growth zone, the spring growth count, the diameter of the focus, the distance
from the focus to the fifth circuli, the distance from the focus to the annulus and the age. Circuli counts
are made along a specific radial line for consistency of results (Figure 1), chosen to be the ventral 20o
radial line (Clutter and Whitesel 1956). This line extends ventro-anteriorly from the focus of the scale,

100

In-season Assessments: Biological Information

forming an angle of 20o with the horizontal or longitudinal axis of the scale and is disclosed by overlaying
the transmitted scale image with a grid onto which a longitudinal axis and two 20o radial lines have been
etched. The circulus count is then made along the ventral 20o radial line.

Table 1. Condition codes used to describe scale condition and available information.

Sockeye have multiple age classes (Table 2) and the PSC uses the Gilbert and Rich nomenclature for age
classification (Clutter and Whitesel 1956). The first number denotes the age at spawning and a subscript
or second number denotes the age at which the sockeye migrated to sea. For example, a 42 aged
sockeye returns to its natal stream to spawn and die at four years of age. It has spent one year in the
lake, migrated to sea in its second year of life and returned to its natal stream after 2 years at sea. The
scales of the sockeye are aged by examining the number of annuli in the freshwater zone and the
number of annuli in the marine zone For Fraser sockeye, the majority of the adult salmon will be 42 and
52 fish.

When all scales of a samples have been aged, each of the scales is re-aged by the same analyst. The
scale data is then merged with the field and sample data within an Excel application that allows for data
entry, data merging, error checking and summarising data. As an error checking tool, it highlights
missing data, outliers, data that does not fall within specific boundaries and unusual data. Once the data
have been merged and error checked, a second scale analyst will re-age and check a large proportion of
the scales. This is another step to ensure aging accuracy, but also to ensure scale interpretation remains
consistent between analysts. Analysts must be experienced and well-trained in aging to differentiate
true annuli from stresses and false checks. The data are then summarized and uploaded into the scale
database for use by the stock identification biologists (Chapter B8).

B8. Stock Composition Estimates Based on Scale
Pattern Analyses

P. Samarasin and S. Latham

Summary
Returning Fraser River sockeye stocks differ in timing and are aggregated into “management
groups” to facilitate their management. Assessments in support of management therefore
require stock composition information. The stock composition of mixed stock fishery samples
can be estimated by comparing the scales from these samples against scale patterns from fish
with known stock origin (i.e., scales collected at spawning grounds). Until 2002, scale-based
methods were the primary mode of stock identification for Fraser River sockeye salmon. Within
the current assessment framework, stock composition estimates derived through scale pattern
analyses provide additional information to refine DNA-based stock proportions (Chapter B9) or
provide estimates when DNA-based stock identification is not available. Although scale pattern
analyses have been used for the last 50 years, the statistical approach has changed over time.
This report provides a summary of historical and current (2018) approaches for scale pattern
analysis for identification of Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks. The current scale pattern
analysis method is a combination of two multivariate statistical methods – linear discriminant
analysis (LDA) with principal components analysis (PCA). Scale pattern data from spawning
ground samples are used to develop discriminant functions for separating Fraser River sockeye
stocks, and the derived functions are applied to in-season scale samples from mixed-stock
fisheries to estimate sample stock proportions. The model output provides stock proportions
for the sample and stock assignment probabilities for individual sockeye salmon.

Introduction
The recognition of differences in scale characteristics among different sockeye salmon stocks is
attributed to Gilbert (1914-1925). However, use of scales to identify Fraser River sockeye stocks was first
examined in the mid-1900s by Hamilton (1947) and Clutter and Whitesel (1956).  At that time, the
analysis used number of circuli in the freshwater zone of the scale to distinguish between stocks within
the Fraser River watershed. Fraser River sockeye typically spend their first year in freshwater where they
can differ considerably in their growth rates. Growth rates depend on freshwater conditions, and rearing
lakes differ in temperature, food availability, and other factors that affect growth.  Fish growth is closely
related to scale growth (Clutter and Whitesel 1956), and growth is recorded in the scales which can be
used to infer the origin of returning adult fish. There is variation in growth rate from year to year,
however, resulting in differences in scale characteristics for any given stock among years. The stock
composition of a mixed-stock fishery can be estimated by comparing growth patterns in a sample of
scales from caught fish to growth patterns of fish with known stock origin (scales collected at spawning
grounds). Here, the sample refers to a collection of scales removed by fisheries observers for
determining the stock composition of the catch.

Data
Sockeye salmon scales (one per fish) collected from fisheries and spawning grounds are read by PSC
scale analysts who determine each salmon’s age and measure scale characteristics (see Chapter B7). The

103

In-season Assessments: Biological Information

following scale variables are directly measured or calculated by scale analysts and are used in the
statistical model to estimate stock composition: first count (count of circuli to the 1st freshwater
annulus), plus or “spring” growth (circulus count between the freshwater annulus and marine growth),
measured distances from the center to annulus, from the center to the 5th circulus, from the 1st circulus
to the annulus, from the 1st to 5th circulus, and the adjusted center width. For generating discriminant
functions: spawning ground scales with readable freshwater zones and known ages (from otoliths) are
used. Only readable scales are included in mixtures for scale pattern analysis, and these may include or
exclude individuals with resorption of their scales that would tend to underestimate the true age.

Methods
Scale pattern analysis methods have changed over time as statistical methods and implementation have
evolved with increasing computation power. Two Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) technical reports
outline the use of scale pattern analysis for identification of Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks. First,
Henry (1961) documented the univariate scale pattern analysis procedure for the identification of Fraser
River sockeye stocks. This method used the number of freshwater circuli to estimate stock composition
of the sample. Historical timing differences among major stock groups and the presence of plus growth
were used to refine estimates but were not formally incorporated in the method. However, this method
was not adequate when there were more than four stocks in the sample and only performed well in
very simple situations. From the late 1970s onwards, PSC staff investigated multivariate methods to
distinguish Fraser River sockeye stocks.  In 1987, Henry’s univariate method was replaced by a
multivariate discriminant analysis method. Gable and Cox-Rogers (1993) documented this multivariate
discriminant analysis, which used first count, plus growth, and distance from 1st circulus to the
freshwater annulus to discriminate among stocks. Stocks expected to be present more than 5% in a
given statistical area during a given catch were included in the discriminant function analysis model and
the expected presence was predicted based on in-season timing abundance curves, historical timing
data, and forecasted run sizes. From 1987-2001, this multivariate scale pattern analysis was the primary
in-season method of stock identification for Fraser River sockeye salmon. DNA-based stock composition
estimation (Chapter B9) became the main method of stock identification in 2002 but scale-based
estimates were still frequently used. From 2009 to 2017, scale-based stock compositions were
infrequently incorporated into accounting files except when suitable DNA-based results were not
available. For each stock, the discriminant function was based on scale standards obtained from
spawning ground samples of the same cohort that returned a year earlier (i.e., age 32 samples were used
for the age 42 model and age 42 samples were used for the age 52 model) and the samples from the
previous year on the cycle (e.g., 2014 age 42 spawning ground samples for 2018 age 42 model). The
resulting stock composition estimates from the discriminant analysis were further revised using a
classification matrix correction procedure (Cook and Lord 1978) which employed misclassification rates
of the spawning ground scales as determined during the development of discriminant function models.
The current statistical approach for scale analysis (2018 onwards) generates stock assignment
probabilities for individual scales (salmon) in the sample (see Table 1), and these probabilities are used
to revise DNA-based stock composition estimates in a total weight of evidence approach (Chapter B9).

The current method is a combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant analysis
(mainly linear discriminant analysis), where discriminant analysis is performed on principal component
scores instead of scale variables directly. Principal component analysis allows information from all
measured scale variables to be used in the discriminant analysis by creating synthetic variables (called
principal components) that are linear combinations of the original variables. Discriminant analysis is a
classification method that allows assignment of stock membership based on a set of independent
variables extracted from non-independent trait measurements (the measured scale variables can be
strongly correlated, so this procedure is necessary). As in the past, scale pattern analyses are conducted
104

In-season Assessments: Biological Information

separately for age 42 and age 52 sockeye salmon. For the age 42 model, spawning ground scales from age
42 individuals from 4 years prior and spawning ground scales from age 32 individuals from the previous
year are used as scale standards (i.e., training data). For the age 52 model, spawning ground scales from
age 42 individuals from the previous year are used as scale standards. Principal component analysis is
performed first on scale variables and the principal component scores for the top five principal
components are retained. A discriminant analysis is performed on principal component scores to
generate discriminant functions from the training data (without incorporating the stock-specific sample
sizes of the training data). Figure 1 illustrates the discriminant function space of 2018 age 42 summer-
run Fraser River sockeye salmon spawning ground samples, which are training data for the 2022 age 42
scale model.

Once the discriminant function has been developed, it can be used to estimate stock assignment
probabilities of in-season scale samples from various fisheries. Scale samples from in-season fisheries
are read and a principal component analysis is performed first on the quantified scale variables.
Principal component scores are retained and rotated similar to the training data. Next, discriminant
analysis is performed to apply the previously developed discriminant functions to the in-season sample
to generate stock assignment probabilities for individual scales in the sample (Table 1), and sample stock
composition estimates (Table 2). Here, prior probabilities are obtained from the relative daily
abundance forecast from the Fisheries Planning Model (Chapter A6). A stock composition estimate for
age 42 and age 52 sockeye in the sample is estimated by assigning each scale to its highest probability
stock (i.e., stock 1) and then applying the bias-correction procedure (Cook and Lord 1978, Table 2) to the
results for each of these ages. A total estimate is obtained through a weighted sum of the stock
composition across ages (including some ages for which no formal statistical model is run, e.g., Harrison
age 31 and 41 scales).

Planned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement

1.  Potentially non-Fraser stocks will be included in the scale model (e.g., Lake Washington, Baker

Lake, Nimpkish, etc.).

2.  For in-season purposes, spawning ground scale data from previous years will be supplemented
with in-season scale data that have a high confidence stock-of-origin (through DNA analysis) for
developing discriminant functions.

3.  The improvement afforded by updating discriminant functions in the post-season with new

spawning ground samples and new relative abundance priors will be evaluated.

4.  The bias-correction method will be reviewed and improved or replaced.

B9. DNA-based Stock ID Method

P. Samarasin and S. Latham

Summary
Fraser River sockeye fisheries are regulated at the level of stock aggregates (Early Stuart, Early
Summer, Summer, and Late run) called management groups, making the identification of Fraser
River sockeye salmon stocks a fundamental requirement for their assessment and
management. Sockeye salmon is an excellent candidate for performing DNA-based stock
identification because of strong natal fidelity, which has led to strong genetic differentiation
over time. DNA-based stock identification has been regularly used by the Pacific Salmon
Commission (PSC) since 2002. Prior to 2002, scale-based stock identification methods were the
primary means of stock identification. Genetic stock identification (GSI) involves extraction of
DNA from tissue samples collected following fisheries and generation of a multi-locus genetic
profile. Genetic profiles from fishery catches of unknown stock composition are subsequently
compared against a genetic baseline with known stock origin using, in our case, the Bayesian
framework as implemented by the CBayes stock identification program. CBayes generates stock
assignment probabilities for individual fish in a sample and summarizes the overall stock
composition for the sample. In-season, stock identification results are used to determine stock-
specific catch estimates as well as stock-specific estimates of upstream migration (Chapter
B17). As such, genetic stock identification results are essential for stock-specific reconstructions
to assess the total run size and timing by management group (Chapter B18).

Introduction
In accordance with the Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST 2020, Chapter 4, section 3), Fraser River sockeye
salmon are managed as four management groups, with each management group consisting of one or
more stocks (Table 1). The membership of stocks among management groups is determined by their
relative migration timing, and not based on spawning ground location (Figure 1). For example, the Early
Summer-run management group contains stocks such as Pitt River sockeye and Nadina River sockeye
with spawning grounds that are about 1000 km apart, whereas other stocks that are spatially closer to
these stocks belong to different management groups, e.g., the Stellako stock which is spatially proximal
to Nadina is part of Summer-run management group. Consequently, stocks within a management group
may experience very different migration difficulties and spawning conditions as adults and freshwater
rearing conditions as juveniles. This may result in very different survival and productivity estimates for
individual stocks within a management group, requiring assessments at finer stock resolutions in
addition to assessment at the management group level. Therefore, high resolution stock identification is
a key component of in-season Fraser River sockeye salmon assessments.

Until 2002, scale-based analyses of mixed-stock fisheries samples (Chapter B8) was the primary means
of Fraser River sockeye stock identification. Even though the PSC’s use of DNA to identify stocks is
relatively new, underlying population genetic principles for conducting genetic stock identification (GSI)
have been well established for decades. DNA-based GSI of other fish and wildlife, using the same
principles, have been conducted since the early 1990s (e.g., van de Ven et al. 1990).

Sockeye salmon populations are excellent candidates for application of DNA-based GSI methods
because of the strong degree of natal fidelity and local adaptation exhibited by the species, leading to
genetic differentiation among populations over time (Taylor 1991, Quinn 2005, Keefer and Caudill 2014).
109

In-season Assessments: Biological Information

The level of genetic differentiation among stocks of interest is the most important determinant of the
success of DNA-based stock identification methods. If genetic differentiation among stocks of interest is
high, GSI methods can easily determine the origin of each fish in a mixed-stock fishery sample (Araujo et
al. 2014). Levels of genetic differentiation between sockeye salmon stocks in the Fraser River and nearby
areas have been studied and shown to be significant among most stocks of interest (Beacham et al.
2004, Beacham et al. 2010). Thus, GSI for estimating Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks in marine and
in-river fisheries gained prominence over time as the scientific basis, accuracy, and reliability of these
methods was demonstrated.

Data
Sockeye salmon DNA is obtained from a small amount of tissue, in the case of Fraser River sockeye
salmon usually collected from the adipose fin of the fish. The baseline or reference samples comprise

111

In-season Assessments: Biological Information

tissues collected from salmon of known stock origin on the spawning grounds; samples of unknown
origin, which get compared to the baseline, are collected from various fisheries. Further details of the
DNA sampling procedure can be found in Chapter B5. Collected tissue samples are sent to the Molecular
Genetics Laboratory at the Pacific Biological Station (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Nanaimo, BC) where
DNA is extracted, loci of interest are amplified through polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and genotypes
are estimated at 14 microsatellite loci (Beacham 2004) and five single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
loci (Beacham 2010). The resulting multi-locus genotypes constitute the genetic profiles of individual
sockeye salmon that are used for further GSI analyses.

Methods
At a conceptual level, GSI analyses are similar to scale-based stock composition analyses. Both methods
compare some characteristics of sockeye of unknown origin against characteristics of salmon with
known origin to estimate the stock composition of the unknown sample. In scale pattern analyses, scale
characteristics are compared, whereas GSI compares allelic frequencies to infer stocks of origin.
Genotypes of fish from spawning ground locations have been collected over years and serve as
reference data or genetic baseline to assign individuals of unknown origin to a stock by determining how
similar their observed genetic profiles are to different baseline samples. The genetic baseline for Fraser
River Panel sockeye analyses includes 50 Fraser River stocks, organized into 19 reported stock groups
(Table 1), and 37 non-Fraser stocks. First, individuals in a mixed-stock fishery sample are assigned to
their stocks of origin by calculating the probability of the individuals originating from different spawning
ground locations (Table 2). Once all individuals are assigned to stocks of origin with corresponding
probabilities, these assignment probabilities are summed to calculate the stock composition of the
entire sample (Table 3). Up to 100 individuals are usually analyzed simultaneously to estimate the stock
composition of a sample. Individuals with eight or more missing loci are excluded from the analysis.

Assignment of individuals to their stocks of origin is implemented in the Cbayes software program
(Neaves et al. 2005). This program analyzes stock mixtures by implementing a Bayesian model described
in detail by Pella & Masuda (2001). Compared to maximum likelihood methods of estimating stock
composition such as SPAM (Debevec et al. 2000), this Bayesian mixture model has more relaxed model
assumptions and more flexibility to deal with incomplete genotypes when some loci are not successfully
amplified by PCR and cannot be scored. Pella and Masuda’s (2001) Bayesian mixture model r treats
baseline genotypes as a sample, rather than a population parameter that is known precisely, relaxing
the need to have very large baseline sample sizes that are truly representative of the population of
interest. Genotypes found in the mixture can also be used to update allele frequency estimates in the
baseline sample. Furthermore, this method better addresses the problem of underestimating more
abundant stocks and overestimating rare stocks (Pella & Masuda 2001). The Fraser River Panel
transitioned from using SPAM estimates to using Cbayes estimates between 2008 and 2011, during
which all previous years’ sockeye DNA samples were re-analyzed with Cbayes.

When running Cbayes, the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic is used to assess convergence of ten independent
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains. This diagnostic helps determine if the probability space is
explored adequately by the search algorithm and if sufficient MCMC samples are utilised when
summarizing results. The raw stock composition results from the Cbayes program are corrected for small
stock bias by reassigning stock estimates below a threshold determined by the sample size. This
removes very small stock estimates that are based on fractions of an individual and reassigns that
proportion estimate to the most frequent stock in the mixture. Next, for each individual, GSI results are

113

In-season Assessments: Biological Information

aligned with the scale-based information and size data. If there is sufficient evidence from these
additional pieces of information to indicate that the GSI result for an individual is inaccurate, the stock
identification biologist adjusts the results based on expert integration of the combined evidence.

Evaluation
Research by Beacham and colleagues characterized the population genetic structure of Fraser River
sockeye salmon (Withler et al. 2000, Beacham et al. 2004) and established the scientific basis for using
DNA-based stock identification (Beacham et al. 2004, Beacham et al. 2006, Beacham et al. 2010).
Beacham et al. (2004) examined inter and intra- population genetic variation for Fraser River sockeye
populations, population genetic differentiation, power of individual loci used for analyses, and accuracy
of stock composition estimates. Most Fraser River sockeye salmon populations of interest exhibit strong
genetic differentiation from each other, and this facilitates successful GSI. The performance of various
GSI methods has been evaluated in the scientific literature (e.g., Araujo et al. 2014, Brenden et al. 2015).
At levels of genetic differentiation typical among Fraser River sockeye stocks, Araujo et al. (2014) found
no significant difference in performance between CBayes and ONCOR (Kalinowski et al. 2007), a popular
alternative GSI software program.

Planned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement
Additional work planned to be undertaken includes:

1.  Explore improving stock identification at the stock level for stocks that are relatively difficult to

distinguish, such as Late Stuart and Stellako.

2.  Explore the potential for distinguishing sub-stocks at the DNA baseline sample level (Table 1).
3.  Establish methods for comparing the efficacy of GSI across sampling areas or conditions, e.g.,

evaluate likelihoods of stocks of origin of individuals unaffected by stock compositions of other
individuals in the same sample mixtures versus the most probable stock of origin identified by
Cbayes.

B10. Daily Estimation of Salmon Passage at the
Mission Site

C.R. Lagasse and Y. Xie

Summary
The PSC operates a hydroacoustic site near Mission, BC, that provides daily estimates of salmon
passage in the Fraser River throughout the summer. When used in combination with daily
species composition estimates (Chapter B16), these estimates contribute to in-season
assessments by providing daily sockeye and pink salmon abundance information for run
reconstructions (Chapter B18), adjustment of test fishery expansion lines (Chapter B4),
prediction of en-route mortality to spawning grounds (Chapter B22), and estimates of Fraser
pink salmon escapement. To sample the entire width of the river at the site, a configuration of
multiple sonar systems is operated at the site, including two shore-based ARIS imaging sonars
(Chapter B13), a side-looking split-beam (Chapter B11), and a mobile, downward looking split-
beam system (Chapter B14). The cross-river location of each sonar and its observed fish targets
are determined based on GPS coordinates and then input into a flux estimation model to
determine the total daily salmon passage.

Introduction
Accurate estimates of daily migration abundance are an integral component of in-season assessments of
Fraser sockeye management groups. Hydroacoustic monitoring provides a non-invasive, continuous
means of monitoring fish migration that is widely used by fisheries agencies for assessing salmon
populations. The PSC (and its predecessor the IPFSC) have operated a hydroacoustics monitoring facility
on the lower Fraser River every summer since 1977 to assess upstream passage of sockeye and pink
salmon. By providing accurate and timely estimates of passage, information from the PSC
hydroacoustics site contributes to in-season run reconstructions (Chapter B18) of Fraser sockeye and
pink salmon runs, adjustments of test fishery expansion lines (Chapter B4), prediction of en route
mortality using management adjustments (Chapter B22) and estimates of Fraser pink salmon
escapement.

The PSC hydroacoustics site is located two kilometers upstream of the Mission Railway Bridge and
approximately 80 kilometers from the mouth of the Fraser River (Figure 1). This location was originally
selected because it is just above the commercial fishing boundary and almost all sockeye populations
migrate past it on their upstream migration (with the exception of Pitt River and Widgeon sockeye). The
river is approximately 400 meters wide at the site and influenced by tidal changes in water height.

116

In-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information

Figure 1. Map of the Lower Fraser River indicating the Mission hydroacoustics monitoring site.

Due to the large channel width, a combination of three or more hydroacoustic systems are deployed to
adequately monitor the salmon migration areas (Figure 2). The nearshore left bank area is monitored by
a stationary split-beam system (Chapter B11) and an ARIS imaging sonar (Chapter B13) deployed at the
end of a fish deflection weir. The ARIS system covers up to the first 30 meters while the split-beam
system extends coverage by an additional 30-60meters. The left bank area is where most of the
upstream migration typically occurs and is a key focus for monitoring efforts. The left bank ARIS system
increases the accuracy of the left bank, especially during periods of high abundance when the split-beam
system has been known to underestimate abundances. The nearshore right bank area is monitored
using another ARIS imaging sonar and typically observes less than 20% of the daily upstream salmon
migration. In addition to abundance information, the ARIS systems on both the left and right bank
provide estimates of salmon species composition using a mixture model based on acoustically observed
fish lengths (Chapter B16). The remaining offshore region is monitored by a mobile, downward-looking
split-beam system deployed from a sampling vessel that transects the river (Chapter B14).

To produce a daily estimate of salmon passage, the data collected by each hydroacoustic system is
processed, analyzed and input into a flux estimation model. This report describes the flux estimation
model for estimating daily salmon passage from a configuration of multiple sonars at the site.

hydroacoustics site. The four systems shown are the left bank ARIS (A1, covering 0 to 30m), the
left bank split-beam (S1, covering 0 to 50m), the mobile split-beam (M), and the right bank ARIS
(A2, covering final 30m). The beam geometries of left bank ARIS (A1) are represented by the
hollow triangles and overlap with the S1 beam geometries which are represented by the filled
coloured triangles. The blue filled offshore area represents the cross-river region sampled by the
mobile split-beam. The gray filled area represents the river bottom. Note that the cross-river
range scale on the x-axis is compressed relative to the vertical depth scale on the y-axis.

Methods
To determine salmon passage across the entire river channel at the Mission hydroacoustics site, the
passage estimates from the four monitoring systems (left bank ARIS, A1; left bank split-beam, S1; mobile
split-beam, M; and right bank ARIS, A2) must be combined. To accomplish this, the cross-river width is
divided into 5 meter range bins, then for each range bin, the salmon passage from a single monitoring
system is applied. The range bins sampled by each system are determined from their GPS location along
with their sampling range and compass bearing. These sampling areas are updated throughout the field
season as the river levels drop and the systems are moved further offshore. The analysis of the
positioning, selection, and addition of sonar system configurations for the daily estimate are completed
using the Flux Estimator software developed by the PSC (Lagasse 2019).

If a range bin is sampled by multiple systems, only the most accurate system is used for the salmon
passage estimate, while other estimates are excluded to avoid double-counting. Estimates from shore-
based systems are preferentially used over mobile estimates whenever possible due to their higher
sampling intensity and more accurate ability to track fish locations and behavior. Where multiple shore-
based systems overlap in sampling area, as is the case with the left bank split-beam and ARIS, the split-
beam is used for the daily estimate in most cases due to its ability to sample a greater portion of the
water column and extrapolate into unsampled areas (Chapter B11). However, during periods of very
high-density fish passage, such as the peak of the Fraser pink migration in 2019, the split-beam cannot
accurately distinguish among fish tracks and may underestimate fish passage, so the left bank ARIS
would be used instead to estimate nearshore salmon passage.

118

In-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information

The distribution of salmon passage across the river channel tends to change throughout a season
depending on river flows, species composition, tidal fluxes, and other factors. River flows and turbidity
are higher in July than August or September, and a greater proportion of the migration occurs in the
offshore areas observed by the mobile system. As flows decrease, the tidal influence on water heights
increases and fish passage becomes more concentrated along the shorelines. During odd-numbered
years when pink salmon return to the Fraser River, migration past the Mission hydroacoustics site is
highly concentrated in near-shore areas, with less than 10% of daily passage observed in offshore
regions.

All of the systems operated at the Mission hydroacoustics site sample throughout the day and night with
the shore-based systems operating continuously for 24 hours a day. Therefore, assuming there are no
gaps in data collection, each estimate of daily salmon passage is based on 24 hours of monitoring data.
To group each day and night period into the same assessment interval, the daily estimates do not
coincide with calendar days, but instead begin at 05:00 each day. For example, the estimate of daily
salmon passage at Mission for July 4 would include data beginning at 05:00a.m. on July 4 and continuing
to 04:59a.m. on July 5.

Data collected by each of the systems is reviewed and processed by 8:30a.m. every morning by PSC staff
throughout the field season to generate the estimate of salmon passage for the previous day. Summary
statistics are calculated for the daily estimate of salmon passage including the ratio of fish travelling
downstream (S1 Ratio downstream, Rd), the proportion of daily passage observed by each sonar system,
the percentage of passage extrapolated in unsampled areas (% Extrapolated), and the number of
transects performed by the mobile sampling vessel and the number of daily targets observed by the
mobile vessel (Table 1). The summary statistics also include total salmon estimates based on alternative
system configurations (e.g., S1+M, A1+M+A2, S1+M+A2 and A1+S1+M+ A2). Once the daily estimate of
total salmon passage is published, the species composition of salmon (Chapter B16) is estimated to
determine the daily passage of sockeye salmon past Mission.

B11. Left Bank Salmon Passage Based on Shore-
based Split-beam Sonar

C.R. Lagasse and Y. Xie

Summary
A shore-based split-beam sonar deployed near the left bank of the Mission hydroacoustics site
is a key component of the estimation system for salmon passage. Split-beam technology was
first adopted for the Mission site in 2004 and has been operated continuously throughout the
salmon monitoring period in all years since then. An hourly stratified sampling design is used for
data collection, consisting of systematic spatial sampling of ten non-overlapping vertical areas
up to a range of 60 metres offshore. The echo data is filtered, tracked, and classified to
distinguish fish tracks from debris, bubbles and other noise. All data is then manually verified by
PSC staff prior to estimating associated abundance by analysing a daily summary of fish tracks
within the flux model (Chapter B12). The left-bank estimate typically accounts for more than
half of the daily salmon passage at the Mission site.

Introduction
Split-beam sonar is widely used for fisheries acoustics in riverine and marine applications around the
world. By collecting information on the position within the sound-beam and signal strength of echoes,
the technology allows fish to be tracked in 3-dimensional space, thereby providing a method for
estimating fish passage in both upstream and downstream directions. Within the Fraser River, split-
beam monitoring at the Mission site was first implemented in 2004 following recommendations from a
hydroacoustics working group in 1994 and feasibility studies from 1995 to 2002 (Xie et al. 2005). Since
2004, a shore-based split-beam sonar has been operated from the left bank of the Mission site to
continuously monitor fish migration in the river and contribute to daily estimates of salmon passage.
This system is generally the most important component of the daily passage estimate because the
majority of salmon migrate closer to the left bank of the site where water flows are weakest.

To estimate fish passage observed by the split-beam, the raw signal of echoes must be filtered,
processed and verified to distinguish between fish and non-fish targets so that detected fish can be
counted using a target-tracking method. Once the left bank split-beam data has been verified, key
statistics of tracked fish, including their abundance and direction of travel, are imported into a flux
model to determine the daily fish passage (Chapter B12). The PSC has developed and refined these
procedures over time and performs them on a daily basis throughout the migration of sockeye and pink
salmon within the Fraser River to provide real-time estimates of daily salmon passage for in-season
management.

Methods

EQUIPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT

At the beginning of each field season, the PSC installs a sectional fish deflection weir (Enzenhofer et al.
2005) on the left bank of the river to allow deployment of its split-beam and imaging sonars (Figure 1),
and to direct the movement of salmon past the sonar systems. The deflection weir is deployed up to a
depth of approximately 4 meters and sections are added to extend the weir throughout the summer as

121

In-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information

river levels drop. The split-beam system is attached to the weir using a U-bracket that allows its depth to
be adjusted in the water column. Conduit poles installed along the entire length of the weir prevent fish
from swimming behind or too close to the transducer.

The split-beam currently used by the PSC is manufactured by Hydroacoustics Technology Incorporated
(HTI) and operates at a frequency of 200 kHz with an elliptical beam geometry of 2° × 10° effective beam
height and width. The beam is oriented with its longer axis parallel to river flow to optimize fish
detection. The transducer is powered by an HTI Model 243 echosounder that is stored in a trailer on
shore. Once deployed, the split-beam system is operated continuously to collect data 24 hours a day
throughout the field season.

Figure 1. The fish deflection weir and deployed split-beam and ARIS imaging sonar on the left
bank of the Mission site. The underwater position and orientation of the split-beam are indicated
by the red square and arrow. A close-up view of the split-beam transducer are shown in the inset
photo.

The elliptical beam geometry of the split-beam can only sample a small portion of the water column,
therefore a stratified sampling design with multiple vertical aims is used for greater sampling coverage.
The stratified sampling design consists of ten aims of non-overlapping, 2° vertical apertures with each
aim sampling for 6 minutes each hour up to a range of 60 metres offshore (Figure 2). The vertical tilt and
bearing of the transducer is controlled by a SIDUS SS250 rotator and monitored using an Impact Subsea
ISD4000 motion reference unit, which also records the water height at the site where tidal influences
can be very pronounced.

DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING

To identify individual targets among the acoustic pings transmitted by the split-beam, the received
echoes are first processed using a single-echo detection (SED) threshold that removes any targets below
an acoustic target strength threshold of approximately -45 dB (Ehrenberg and Torkelson 1996). The
target strength of adult salmon is normally greater than -40 dB, therefore the SED filters out most
signals that are too weak and/or too narrow (relative to the projected pulse width) to have originated
from a salmon. The SED filtered single-target data are analyzed using an alpha-beta tracker (Blackman

122

In-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information

and Popoli 1999) to form tracks of detected targets, following the targets over time in a three-
dimensional space. An automated discriminant function analysis (DFA) is then applied to the target
tracks to distinguish fish tracks from debris or other noise (Xie at al. 2012). In some cases, particularly
during the peak migration of pink salmon, a DFA is not applied because it cannot distinguish dense
schools of fish from noise.

Following the automated fish track identification, the tracks are manually verified by trained staff that
review the echogram data using the Split-beam Fishtrack graphic user interface editing software
developed by the PSC (Figure 3). Targets are verified by examining the summary statistics of target track
features such as speed, direction of travel, and target strength, as well as looking for broader patterns in
the distribution of echoes in the water column. For example, bottom echoes can be visually identified
and removed based on their very low speeds, clumped distributions and consistent sampling ranges.
This processing and editing procedure is performed daily for every hour of split-beam data.

The verified fish tracks are then exported into a spreadsheet containing statistics on the target strength,
number of pings, direction of travel, and the 3-dimensional location and speed for each of the individual
verified fish tracks. These data are then imported into the PSC Flux Estimator software for further
summary and analysis (Chapter B12). The flow chart in Figure 4 describes the steps of left bank split-
beam data processing.

Figure 2. Hourly sampling design of the left bank split-beam system (red square) with the ten
vertical aims represented by coloured wedges. Each of the aims has a vertical height of 2°,
resulting in a total coverage of 20° of the water column. The maximum sampling range is 60
meters, though many of the aims near the river boundaries use reduced ranges to avoid
interference from the water surface or river bottom. The gray filled area represents the river
bottom as profiled in July 2018.

Planned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement
Over the last decade, the split-beam system on the left bank has relied on an HTI 2° × 10° transducer and
Model 243 echosounder for data collection. In the near future, this equipment will need to be replaced.
HTI has discontinued support for its echosounders requiring alternative suppliers to be explored. An
ARIS sonar has been in use on the left bank since 2017 (Chapter B13) and research is currently on-going

124

to compare the fish passage estimates between the ARIS and split-beam systems and to eventually
phase out the split-beam system.

beam System

Y. Xie and PSC Hydroacoustics Staff

Summary
Fish passage in the Fraser River in the left-bank nearshore area at Mission is monitored with a
multi-aimed split-beam sonar (Chapter B11). Sounding ranges at steeper (either upper or lower)
aims are significantly shortened to avoid echoes from the river bottom and water’s surface.
While fish passage in the ensonified zone can be directly estimated, passage in the acoustic
blind zones is projected from observed passage values using a nearest-neighbour extrapolation
algorithm.

Introduction
Fish passage in nearshore areas, up to 60m from either bank, is monitored by shore-based side-looking
sonar systems. On the right bank, the bottom of the nearshore area is generally concave. This allows an
ARIS with a single vertical aim with a beam-width of 15o, to effectively sample the entire water column
for the nearshore area on the right bank (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Sampling ranges for the left and right banks nearshore areas. The left-bank split-beam
system (LB.S1) uses 10-aim stratified unequal ranges to sample the nearshore water column. The
right-bank ARIS system (RB.A2) uses a single-aim to sample the nearshore water column (out to
40m).

On the left-bank, the bottom of the nearshore area is convex. This area therefore requires stratified
sampling of fish passage in the left-bank nearshore area with a split-beam system on a rotator allowing
for stratified sampling at 10 aims. The multiple aims allow flexibility in sampling different portions of the
water column with optimal sounding ranges. Sounding ranges at upper or lower aims are significantly
shortened to avoid echoes from river boundaries (i.e. the river bottom and water’s surface). However,
the differential sounding ranges for different aims can result in acoustic blind zones near the river
surface and bottom. While fish passage in the ensonified zone can be directly estimated (Chapter B11),
passage in the blind zone is projected from observed flux values using a nearest-neighbour extrapolation
algorithm (Bowman and Azzalini 1997).

DATA COLLECTION

The left-bank split-beam system is deployed at the end of a fish deflection fence as shown in Figure 2.
The 2o × 10o split-beam transducer uses an hourly systematic sampling scheme to sample the nearshore
water column at 10 non-overlapping aims with a sampling time of 6 minutes per aim (see Chapter B11
for details). After a 24-hour sampling period, the system obtains a cumulative distribution for the
nearshore fish passage as shown in Figure 3.

site. The underwater position and orientation of the split-beam sonar are indicated by the red
square and arrow.

Figure 3. Cumulative fish distribution (black dots) over a 24-hour sampling period by the left-bank
split-beam system. For the monitored nearshore area (within the 2 vertical black lines), there are
areas not ensonified by the sound-beam. Fish passage through these blind zones is estimated by
the nearest-neighbour method.

REPRESENTATION OF LEFT-BANK NEARSHORE CROSS-SECTION WITH FINITE CELLS

To estimate the total abundance of fish in the left-bank nearshore cross-section, the area is represented
by 2 dimensional cells, each 5m wide and 1m high (Xie 2002), as shown in Figure 4. Note that in these
cross-section plots the river bottom is the vertical reference (y = 0) so that the flat surface of the mean
waterline is transformed to a curvy line (the red line) which mirrors the river bottom.  Based on the
proportion of the cell ensonified and the proportion of the cell under water, cells are classified into 5
classes:

1.  Fully ensonified and fully submerged cells (e.g. cells indicated by the black arrows in Fig. 4);
2.  Partially ensonified and fully submerged cells with coverage >50% (e.g. cells indicated by the

green arrows in Fig. 4);

3.  Partially ensonified and fully submerged cells with coverage <50% (e.g. cells indicated by the

blue arrows in Fig. 4);

4.  Partially submerged cells (e.g. cells indicated by the pink arrows in Fig. 4);
5.  Cells completely above the waterline (e.g. cells indicated by the purple arrows in Fig. 4).

Figure 4. Classifications of 2 dimensional cells by the proportions ensonified and submerged.  A
total of 5 classes are identified, examples of which are shown by arrows of different colors (see
text for details). Values in individual cells are estimates of hourly fish flux through the cells (see
next section for details).

CALCULATIONS OF HOURLY FISH FLUX THROUGH INDIVIDUAL CELLS

The hourly fish flux, i.e. the number of fish per hour, is calculated using different methods for the 5
classes of cells, as outlined below.

For fully ensonified cells that are fully submerged in the water (type 1), the hourly fish flux (f) is
calculated by a linear expansion of the number of fish observed daily in the cell (N) divided by the total
daily sampling minutes (T):

(1)

𝑓1 =

𝑁
𝑇

  × 60.

128

In-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information

For cells that are fully submerged and ensonified for more than 50% (type 2), the hourly flux f is
calculated the same way, except that an area expansion factor (1/α with α being the ensonified
proportion of the cell area) is applied to equation 1 to expand the observed flux to the entire area of the
cell:

(2)

𝑁
𝑓2 = (
𝑇

  × 60 ) /𝛼.

For instance, if the sound-beam ensonifies 75% of the cell area, then the expansion factor would be
1/0.75 = 1.33 .

For cells that are fully submerged and ensonified for less than 50% (type 3), we consider the observed
area to be too small to expand the observed flux to the entire cell area. Instead, the flux in the area that
is not ensonified is based on the flux in the nearest-neighbour cell, by taking the mean of the estimated
flux in the horizontally (fh), vertically (fv) and diagonally (fd) neighbouring cells. The total flux for this class
of cells is then:

with 𝛼 indicating the ensonified proportion of the cell area and (1-𝛼) indicating the area for which the
nearest-neighbour method is used to derive the hourly flux. Taking the cell with the flux value of 542.72
(fish/hour) in Figure 4 as an example, we demonstrate the application of Equation 3 to this partially
ensonified cell. In this example, the ensonified proportion for the area of this cell is 33% and the flux in
this area is 237 fish/hour. The nearest neighbour method projects a flux of 456.3 = (569.17 + 343.37+
360.83)/3 (fish/hour). Therefore, the flux for this cell is, according to Equation 3: 𝑓3 = 237 +
(1 − 0.33) × 456.3 = 542.7 fish/hour.

For cells not fully submerged in the water (type 4), the estimated flux for a entire cell produced by the
above calculations must be reduced by a factor of β, the submerged portion of the cell:

(4)

𝑓4 = 𝛽 ∙ 𝑓.

Taking the cell with the flux value of 402.89 fish/hour in Figure 3 as an example, we estimate the flux for
this cell based on the nearest-neighbour method to be 469.3 = (295.9 + 542.72 + 569.17) / 3 fish/hour,
assuming the cell is fully submerged. However, this cell is only 85.8% submerged; therefore, the flux for
this cell according to Equation 4 is: 𝑓4 =0.858 × 469.3 = 403 fish/hour. The fish flux for cells entirely
above the waterline (type 5) is zero.

FLUX ESTIMATOR SOFTWARE

The representation of the left-bank cross section by 5m × 1m cells and the above calculations of
ensonified and submerged proportions of individual cells are implemented by the Visual C++ based
software program, FluxEstimator. The software includes a graphical user interface (GUI) system to allow
the user to visually examine the outputs of flux values for individual cells. Users can use the GUI to over-
rule extrapolated flux for individual cells if the flux values appear either too high or too low relative to
the neighbouring cells’ values. However, in most data scenarios, the flux outputs are not altered.

The FluxEstimator graphs are presented in Figure 5. The top graph shows the upstream fish targets while
the bottom graph show targets that move downstream. In this example, the net upstream flux
(upstream flux – downstream flux) in the ensonified area is 4039.6 fish/hour. The fish flux in the blind
zones is calculated using the methods described in the previous section (Xie et al. 2005). In this example,
the net upstream hourly flux through the entire left-bank monitoring area is 5297.33 fish/hour. In this
scenario, the extrapolated flux accounts for 23.7% of the total estimated flux.

B13. Shore-based Imaging Sonar Systems

M. Bartel Sawatzky

Summary
Imaging sonar technology such as DIDSON and ARIS systems provides visually intuitive data that
are currently used by fisheries biologists to estimate salmon escapement and species
composition in the Fraser River. This technology has been utilized officially at the Pacific Salmon
Commission’s Mission hydroacoustics monitoring site since 2009. This document outlines the
deployment, sampling design, and fish counting methods for the imaging data generated by the
Sound Metrics ARIS 1800 system as it is currently used in the hydroacoustics program.

Introduction
The Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) hydroacoustics program has been enumerating upstream salmon
passage through the lower Fraser River at Mission since 1977. Over the years, various new technologies
have been tested and adopted to improve the accuracy of salmon passage estimates. The program
started with a single-beam sonar system and a split-beam system was added to the program in 2004.
These systems however did not allow to visually identify the objects passing the monitoring site, which
can cause problems when there is a lot of debris in the river or during periods of very dense upstream
migration.  In 2001, acousticians and sonar engineers from the University of Washington developed a
high-resolution image sonar system that allow users to visually identify detailed shapes of underwater
objects. The sharp resolution and the ease of use and interpretation of the image information make
imaging sonar one of the best tools for observing fish behaviour in a turbid riverine environment such as
the lower Fraser River at Mission, B.C.

Imaging sonar technology has been utilized in the PSC hydroacoustics program since 2004, beginning
with trials of the DIDSON system (Dual-Frequency Identification Sonar, Belcher et al. 2002) to assess its
ability to estimate fish flux in areas ensonified by the left bank split-beam system (Chapter B11). These
trials also assessed the DIDSON system for the purposes of estimating fish flux in blind zones of the left
bank split-beam system, identifying non-salmonid fish targets and obtaining statistics on fish behaviour
(Xie et al. 2005). After the successful completion of these trials, the DIDSON system was officially
integrated into the PSC hydroacoustics program in the summer of 2009 to monitor upstream salmon
passage (Lagasse et al. 2017).

Initial experiments with an ARIS 1800 system were conducted during the 2015 field season to compare
its data to the data collected by the DIDSON and 2° x 10° split-beam transducer deployed from the left
bank of the Mission hydroacoustic site. This comparison revealed that the ARIS, with its increased
resolution, produced similar counts to the DIDSON at close range on the left bank (Lagasse et al. 2016).
Similar comparisons of the ARIS and DIDSON imaging sonar systems continued for the 2016 field season,
this time with the two units sampling the same portion of the water column. This further testing showed
that the ARIS and DISON systems produced statistically identical results of fish passage (Lagasse et al.
2017).

Currently, the ARIS imaging sonar systems are deployed on both the right and left banks, capturing
approximately 60-80% of the total daily salmon passage at the Mission site (Conrad et al. 2019). While
testing is underway to also employ the ARIS on the vessel transecting the mid-section of the river, the
current document focuses on the ARIS data collection and counting methodology used to produce
nearshore estimates.

Methods

SYSTEM DEPLOYMENT AND DATA COLLECTION

The PSC Mission hydroacoustic site is located 80km upstream from the mouth of the Fraser River where
the maximum width of the river is approximately 450 metres and the maximum depth varies from 13 to
17 metres depending on discharge levels. The site is operational during the sockeye and pink salmon
migration periods, generally from early July to September or October each year. The hydroacoustics site
is comprised of the left bank field site, which houses the majority of the field site equipment, and the
right bank field site, directly across the river from the left bank site.

Right bank
The right bank field site is an off-grid location directly across the Fraser River from the main work trailer
of the Mission program. It is powered by a battery bank which is charged by solar and gas-generator
power. The ARIS system is mounted with a pole-mount to an aluminum cross arm attached to the end of
a telescopic fish weir (Enzenhofer and Cronkite 2005). Fully deployed, the fish weir extends 20m from
the river bank. The river profile on the right bank has a gradual downward slope which is ensonified by
an ARIS 1800 unit using one vertical aim, varying between -3° to -8° depending on water levels, to a
maximum range of 40m. The aim is split into 4 range bins (Figure 1) and the ARIS system is programed to
record each range bin for 10 minutes per hour. The resulting files are transferred wirelessly to the left
bank trailer for on-site processing by staff.

Figure 1. Diagram of the right bank ARIS sampling scheme.

Left bank
The left bank field site houses the main passage estimation systems. As much as 80% of salmon passage
occurs on the left bank and it is monitored using both an HTI split-beam system and an ARIS 1800
imaging sonar. Both systems are mounted to the end of a large fish weir that also acts as a dock and
walkway for two vessels that are used at the site. The HTI split-beam system normally samples to a
range of 50 to 60 metres, and the ARIS system overlaps the HTI split-beam system to a maximum range
of 45 metres. This overlap in sampling area allows the ARIS system to be used as a data verification tool
during low to medium abundance scenarios. As left bank passage increases, the split-beam system may
become saturated and its individual target recognition capabilities are diminished. The ARIS system does
a much better job of tracking individual targets when abundances are high and is relied upon for near
shore (0-30m) passage during peak migration events. Further information on the left-bank splitbeam
system can be found in Chapter B11.

132

In-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information

Due to the semi-convex shape of the nearshore river bottom on the left bank and the limited vertical
beam-width of the imaging sonar, the ARIS system requires multiple vertical aims to sample the entire
water column in the first range bin of 0-10m (Figure 2). Two vertical aims (approximately -14°, 0°
depending on system deployment and water height) are used for the first range bin. The two nearshore
aims are configured to minimise “blind areas” near the river bottom and upper water column which can
accommodate high salmon passage due to tidal influences. The three farther range bins (10-40m) are
sampled using a single aim (-3o) as the vertical beam width of the ARIS system can adequately cover the
water column at those ranges. Each aim and range bin are sampled individually on a systematic hourly
sampling schedule. Fish passage in each of the stratified spaces is recorded for 10 minutes per hour.

Figure 2. The non-overlapping stratified hourly sampling spaces by the left bank ARIS system. The
left-bank ARIS system is mainly relied upon for passage up to 30 metres nearshore while the
splitbeam system extends the sampling range up to 60 metres.

DATA PROCESSING

Counting Procedures
The ARIS data are collected hourly and each aim/bin is sampled for 10 minutes per hour (Figure 2). The
files are uploaded to the central processing computer where they are counted by hydroacoustics staff
using the ARISFish software specifically designed by Sound Metrics for post-processing of ARIS data. The
staff members count all upstream and downstream fish targets with tally counters, regardless of size, for
the first 5 minutes of each file. The coefficient of variation (CV) associated with the resulting hourly fish
count estimates is 6.5% (Xie and Martens 2014).  It is possible to count the entire 10 minutes of each
recording, but the gain in precision is minor (CV of 5.5%). During low abundance scenarios, the playback
framerate of the sonar files can be increased to complete the counts faster. When passage rates

133

In-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information

increase, it becomes challenging to count the files in real time, so the framerate is decreased to ensure
the counts are accurate.

Generating an Imaging Sonar Passage Estimate.
Once the Imaging sonar counts associated with a 24 hour period are complete, a total daily fish passage
estimate is calculated. In order to generate a passage estimate for salmon, non-salmon species must be
removed from the total fish counts. This is achieved by taking length measurements of a subset of fish
images from the same imaging sonar files used for fish counting and running them through a mixture
model to calculate the proportion of salmon sized targets (Chapter B15). Those proportions are then
applied to the corresponding counts to derive the daily salmon passage estimates for both the right and
left bank ARIS systems. The ARIS data are then ready to be included in the daily total salmon estimate
which also includes passage estimates from the left bank and mobile split-beam systems (Chapter B10).

B14. Offshore Salmon Passage Based on Mobile
Transecting Split-beam System

Y. Xie and PSC Hydroacoustics Staff

Summary
At the PSC hydroacoustic site at Mission, salmon are known to utilize the entire 400m river
width of the Fraser River as they migrate upstream. While nearshore areas up to 50m from
either bank are well monitored by the shore-based sonar systems (Chapter B11 and B13), fish
migrating beyond this range are monitored by a downward looking mobile split-beam sonar
system deployed from a vessel continuously transecting the river. The transect sampling of the
river by the mobile split-beam system acquires information on fish density in the offshore area.
This density information is combined with fish speed and direction of travel statistics through a
mobile fish flux model to produce a daily estimate of offshore fish passage.

Introduction
During the summer monitoring season, the width of the Fraser River at the PSC Hydroacoustic
monitoring site is, on average, 400m. Due to the reduced strength of underwater sound over longer
distances, side-looking sonar systems are unable to effectively detect salmon targets across the entire
river. According to Medwin and Clay (1998), in 15oC fresh water, a 200 kHz sound loses approximately 1
decibel of its magnitude per 100m of propagation, or in a linear scale, the sound loses 20% of its
intensity per 100m due to attenuation.

At the Mission site, salmon are however known to utilize the entire river width for their upstream
migration. Fish migrating in nearshore areas (up to 50m from either bank) are well monitored by the
shore-based sonar systems; fish beyond this nearshore range are monitored by a downward looking
mobile split-beam sonar system deployed from a vessel that continuously transects the river at the site.
For more information regarding the configuration of the Hydroacoustics site, please see Chapter B10.

The mobile split-beam system acquires data used to estimate fish density in the offshore area. This
density information is combined with behavioural statistics, such as fish speed and direction of travel,
using a mobile fish flux model, which results in a daily estimate of offshore fish passage. Since the
mobile system cannot reliably measure the swimming behaviour of fish while transecting the river,
parameters such as speed and direction of travel are based on the fish behaviour in the left-bank
nearshore area measured by the left-bank split-beam system (Chapter B11).

Data
The mobile split-beam data are collected using a downward looking split-beam transducer towed by a
vessel that continuously transects the Fraser River. The vessel is a 6.7m long aluminum hull motorboat
(Figure 1a) and its beam (width) is 2.6m with a 0.9m draft in fresh water. The moderately V-shaped hull
is designed specifically for surveying fish in shallow waters. The vessel is powered by a stern-drive Volvo
Penta 3.0-liter gasoline engine which drives a 3-bladed propeller. During normal transecting, the
propeller is kept at a rotational speed ranging from 1200 to 2000 rpm depending upon the discharge
level and tidal currents. A GPS receiver is installed onboard to record the transecting trajectory and
speed during mobile surveys. On average, it takes about five minutes for the vessel to complete a cross-
river transect at the site at a mean cruising speed of 1.4 m/sec (or 2.7 knots). Excluding time spent on

135

In-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information

stationary sampling and shift changes and refueling, the vessel completes on average a total of 170
transects per day. The vessel has little impact on the natural behavior of migrating fish at water depths
greater than 4m (Xie et al 2008).

To survey fish in the offshore areas of the river, which are at most 18m deep, a Biosonics 6o circular
nominal split-beam transducer powered by a DT-X echosounder (http://www.biosonicsinc.com) is
deployed from the vessel. The transducer is mounted on a towed body on the port side of the vessel
(Figure 1b) and is kept in a downward-looking orientation while being towed. The transducer emits
0.2ms long 210-kHz acoustic pulses at a ping rate of 20 pings per second. The sounder’s source level is
set at 220dB. Echoes with echo levels exceeding -130dB are logged into the hard drives of the sounder.
This raw echo data is suitable for single-echo-detection (SED) processing (Ehrenberg and Torkelson
1996). The SED processing removes any echo signals with acoustic target strength (TS) below -45 dB
(adult salmon normally possess TS > -40dB).

Because the downward looking split-beam system cannot be used to derive behavioral data, these data
are obtained from the stationary left-bank split-beam system instead (Chapter B11).

downward looking split-beam transducer.

Methods

OFFSHORE FISH DENSITY

The raw echo data are analyzed using an alpha-beta tracker (Blackman and Popoli 1999) by forming
tracks of detected targets, that allow to follow the targets over time in a three-dimensional Cartesian
space (X, Y, Z). The identified fish tracks are verified by trained staff that review the echogram data with
interactive editing software to remove non-fish targets (Figure 2). The tracks are identified by examining
the summary statistics of tracks such as their target strength, detection probability, continuity in the
space-time domain (echogram) of track trajectories, as well as their echogram patterns prior to SED
processing (the raw echo patterns). This visual critiquing and editing procedure is performed each day
for all the split-beam data using the Split-beam Fishtrack software developed by the PSC (Xie 2004). The
fish track data produced by the mobile split-beam system provides daily estimates of the average
number of fish detected per transect across the river. With associated GPS location data, we can obtain
the spatial distributions of the detected fish for a cross-section of the river at Mission (Figure 3).

OFFSHORE FISH PASSAGE

With the fish density information acquired from the mobile split-beam system using the alpha-beta
tracker as well as the Fishtrack software and fish behavior statistics estimated from the left-bank
system, a fish flux model is used to combine these two types of information to calculate fish flux: the
daily number of fish migrating upstream in the offshore area surveyed by the mobile sounding vessel.

137

In-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information

Detailed descriptions of the model can be found in Xie et al. (2002, 2005).  The key derivations and
resulting model estimator are listed below.

To derive the total daily abundance in the offshore area, the offshore fish density data are summarized
by individual cells (Figure 4).

It has been shown (Xie et al 2002, 2005) that the net upstream fish flux for each cell can be obtained
through the following formula:
𝑓 =   𝑚𝑇𝑣𝑢
𝐿

] ∙ [1 − 2 𝑛𝑑
𝑛𝑑+𝑛𝑢

  [1 − (1 − 𝑣𝑑
𝑣𝑢

𝑛𝑑
𝑛𝑑+𝑛𝑢∙𝑣𝑑/𝑣𝑢

) ∙

where L is the full beam-width of the sound-beam at mean depth of the cell, mT is the mean number of
fish detected per transect at the cell over a 24-hour sampling period by the mobile split-beam system,
𝑣𝑢 and 𝑣𝑑 are the mean speeds of the up- and down-stream fish detected by the left-bank split-beam
system over the 24-hour sampling period, and nu and nd are the totals of up- and down-stream fish
detected by the left-bank split-beam system over the 24-hour sampling period.

This above equation combines information obtained from the mobile system (transect measurements of
mT) and the left-bank systems (shore-based stationary measurements of mean speed and up- versus
down-stream fish) to produce a measure of offshore fish flux through individual cells.  Summation of the
offshore flux over all the offshore cells provides us with the estimate of total offshore fish flux. The key
underlying assumption of this equation is that fish behaviour is statistically similar between nearshore
and offshore areas. Xie et al (2007) however showed differential behaviour between fish migrating in
the inshore areas of left and right banks. Therefore, a direct measurement of offshore fish behaviour
would provide more accurate behavioural parameter estimates than the current method and would
improve the overall estimate of mobile flux.

upstream through individual cells (5m horizontal by 1m vertical) per hour with red colored cells

system for this day is 2819.89 fish/hour. Note: the flux data is displayed in the plot using the river
bottom as the vertical reference so that the flat surface waterline is transformed to a curvy line
(the blue line) which mirrors the river bottom.

B15. Length-based Mixture Model for Imaging Sonars

J.L. Nelitz, C. Lagasse and Y. Xie

Summary
At the PSC Hydroacoustics Site in Mission, BC, information collected from imaging sonars
(DIDSON and ARIS) has been used since 2011 to estimate fish passage in nearshore areas off
both the left and right banks (Chapter B13). To accurately determine the proportion of fish
passage that is comprised of salmon, a length-based mixture model is used to estimate the
relative proportions of salmon-sized targets versus small, resident-fish-sized targets. The
mixture model is also used to estimate proportions among salmon species, including pink,
sockeye, and Chinook, during periods when two or more salmon species are co-migrating past
the PSC Hydroacoustics site. Fish length data used by the model are measured from sub-
samples of the acoustic images collected by the imaging sonars. The mixture-model-based
estimates of salmon proportions are applied to fish passage estimates in nearshore areas on
both the left and right banks and are used to produce imaging-sonar-based estimates of daily
nearshore upstream salmon passage.

Introduction
A variety of fish species, either migrating past or residing in the proximity of the PSC Hydroacoustics Site,
are detected and imaged by the imaging sonar at the monitoring site. However, the mandate of the PSC
Hydroacoustics program is to enumerate salmon passage past the site, specifically sockeye and pink
salmon. Therefore, salmon passage must be distinguished from passages of non-salmon species. Salmon
species in the Fraser River include Chinook, chum, coho, pink, and sockeye, while resident fish include
Peamouth Chub, White Sturgeon, Red-sided Shiners, and a variety of other species (Figure 1).

Imaging sonar acquires acoustic images of fish while they migrate in the river, which allows for the
counting of fish as they migrate past the site and the measurement of lengths of individual fish. See
Chapter B13 for more information on imaging sonar at the Hydroacoustics site. To differentiate salmon-
sized targets from small resident fish, fork lengths (FL), the length from the fish’s nose to its tail, are
measured from a subset of the imaging sonar data. Since 2011, a length-based mixture model has been
applied to imaging-sonar-based length data at the PSC hydroacoustics site to estimate species
proportions. The mixture model statistically distinguishes small resident fish from migrating salmon to
generate accurate salmon passage in nearshore areas. Length data are collected and compiled daily and
analyzed using the mixture model. The estimated proportions of both small resident fish (around 20 cm
in mean FL) and salmon-sized fish (> 40 cm in FL) are applied to the total fish counts produced by the
imaging sonar to derive the daily nearshore salmon passage estimates off both banks. The mixture-
model-based species proportions can also be used to estimate relative abundances among salmon
species. This is used during the Chinook and sockeye comigration period (July to early August) or the
initial pink and sockeye comigration period (mid-August to early September) to estimate the abundance
of each species. There are other estimation methods for salmon species composition, for more
information, see Chapter B16. This document describes the key procedures for measuring lengths from
sonar images, and how these lengths are used by the mixture model to estimate species proportions.

BC. Chinook salmon (A), chum salmon (B), coho salmon (C), pink salmon (D), sockeye salmon (E),
Peamouth Chub (F), White Sturgeon (G) and Red-sided Shiners (H).

Data
A subset of ARIS fish images are measured to determine their fork lengths (FL) using the vendor
provided software, ARISFish. The fork length refers to the length from the fish’s nose to the fork of its
tail. Because the resolution of the images produced by the imaging sonar often does not allow for the
exact identification of the true ‘fork’ of the fish tails, the locations of the fork are subject to random
error. A comparison study between biological FL and acoustically measured FL for sockeye indicates
however that acoustically measured FL by imaging sonar is unbiased (Xie et al. 2013).

Over a 24-hour period, a total of 8 hours (per range bin) of imaging data are subsampled with 20 fish
images selected for length measurements. This produces a total of 160 FL measurements for each of the
range bins. For the left bank, the image data from all 4 range bins are used for length measurements.
This gives a daily total of 20 × 4 × 8 = 640 length measurements per day for the left bank. For the right
bank, due to the degrading imaging quality in the furthest bin, the species composition information for
Bin3 is used for Bin4. This gives a daily total of 480 length measurements for the right bank per day.

Corresponding fish passage is counted for 5 minutes per hour in each of the range bins from both the
left and right-bank acoustic sites. All fish, except Sturgeon, are counted, including small, presumably
resident fish. In addition to the length measurements of fish for which the species is unknown, the
mixture model also relies on species-specific length information obtained from test fishing catches in the
current as well as previous years. These historical FL data are used as mean length priors in the mixture
model.

Methods
Once all the length measurements for a range bin are available, a mixture model is fitted to the resulting
distribution of length data to estimate the proportion of different species within the mixture (Figure 2).
Three different estimation methods can be used: maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), discriminant
function analysis (DFA) and single-value-threshold (SVT) method. The mixture model requires initial
values for the means and standard deviations for the distributions of lengths for the different fish
species that make up the mixture, i.e. the mean fork length and associated standard deviations for each
species. The mean fork lengths of each salmon species is based on the average lengths observed in
nearby test fisheries. Early in the season, when test fishing catches are still limited, marine FL data or
previous’ year means can be relied upon until more relevant data become available. While the
acoustically measured FL is unbiased, the measured lengths are subject to random, unbiased errors due
to various factors such as the aspect angle and the range of ensonified fish. This results in a sigma or a
coefficient of variation (CV) of acoustically measured length for sockeye salmon that is larger than that

141

In-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information

of the true length distribution: 13% vs. 6% (see Figure 3). The mixture model assumed a CV of 13% for
both sockeye and Chinook’s measured lengths. The assumption of Chinook’s measured lengths having
the same CV as sockeye needs to be verified in the future. In addition to prior information on the mean
length and the coefficient of variation, the model also requires prior information on the number of
species to be classified. The most used prior for the number of groups is a 3: small resident fish, sockeye,
and chinook salmon. This 3-group mixture model is used during the early part of the sockeye migration
when the river is dominated by these 3 groups and throughout the season during non-pink years. A 4- or
5-group mixture model is used when pink salmon are co-migrating and/or when the lower river test-
fishing programs indicate a noticeable presence of jack Chinook in the river.

acquired by ARIS on the left bank from July 9 to July 28, 2019. Based on these data, the mixture
analysis estimates 69% small resident fish, 22% sockeye, and 9% Chinook salmon.

length measurements of 394 fish images acquired by DIDSON at Mission during the sockeye

measured length is 62.3cm. The standard deviations of the 2 data sets are 3.6cm and 8cm,
resulting in coefficients of variation of 6% and 13%, respectively.

Due to the temporal variation of salmon influx in a 24-hour monitoring period, the unweighted sampling
of hydroacoustic length data could result in biased species composition estimates, especially when

142

In-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information

differentiating salmon from resident, non-salmon species. To reduce the bias, the length-based mixture
model is also applied to the hourly data. The resulting abundance-weighted model uses a spline-fit
algorithm to reconstruct a full time series of hourly salmon proportions from the subsampled length
data (Figure 4). Multiplying this hourly proportion time series with the hourly abundance time series
leads to an abundance-weighted daily salmon proportion. The details of the mixture model can be
reviewed on pages 44-51 of Xie et al. (2013). The model is implemented using the statistical software
package R and can be readily run under the platform of R-Studio (https://rstudio.com/).

Figure 4. Reconstructed hourly salmon proportion time series for September 24, 2018, indicating
both the 8 hours of observed proportions (black circles) as well as projected proportions (red
circles). The daily salmon proportion was estimated to be 74%.

One of the advantages of the length-based mixture model is that it allows to provide species
composition information on days when test fishing catches are absent or small. In addition, model
results tend to be robust when distinguishing small resident fish from sockeye and adult Chinook.
However, when using a 4 or 5-group mixture model during the periods of comigration with pink salmon
and/or relatively large proportions of jack Chinooks, resulting species composition estimates can be
subject to large uncertainties given the limited differences in average lengths between the species.

B16. Species Information: Overview

C.G.J. Michielsens

Summary
Species composition estimates are essential for translating daily fish passage estimates at the
hydroacoustic site at Mission, BC, into daily sockeye abundance estimates. Since 2009, fish
passage at the hydroacoustic site has been estimated using a combination of split-beam and
imaging sonars (DIDSON and ARIS, Chapter B13). A mixture model is applied to histograms of
fish length data measured from the imaging files to estimate the relative proportions of
salmon-sized targets versus small, resident-fish-sized targets and to derive daily salmon
abundance estimates (Chapter B15). The abundance estimates can be further separated by
salmon species using a variety of different data sources and methods. The different methods
each have their own shortcomings which may be more pronounced depending on sample sizes
and the relative and/or absolute abundance of the different species. The selection of the
method to estimate species specific abundances is dependent on the concurrence between
estimates, known biases under different conditions, and sample sizes. The following reports
provide an overview of the different methods and describes some of these biases.

Introduction
As part of the Treaty agreements (Diplomatic Note of August 13, 1985), the Fraser River Panel is
responsible for the collection of hydroacoustic data at Mission, BC, and to enumerate salmon passage
past the site, specifically sockeye and pink salmon. The process to estimate the number of sockeye and
pink salmon is a two staged process. First, salmon passage must be distinguished from passage of non-
salmon resident fish species, which include Peamouth Chub, White Sturgeon, Redside Shiner, and a
variety of other species. This is done by measuring the acoustic lengths of individual fish and fitting a
mixture model to the resulting distribution of length data to estimate the proportion of salmon versus
resident fish (Chapter B15). In a second stage, the proportion of sockeye and/or pink salmon will need to
be determined. Within the Fraser River, salmon species also include Chinook, chum, and coho salmon.
The proportion of Chinook salmon can be substantial when sockeye abundances are low early in the
season or during years of low sockeye abundance. There are a multitude of different methods that can
be used to determine species composition and the different methods will be described here as well as
their known biases.

Methods

SALMON VERSUS NON-SALMON SPECIES PROPORTIONS

The distinction of salmon versus non-salmon species is made using fish length measurements of
individual fish acquired using the acoustic image of the fish obtained through imaging sonar. More
specifically, the fork lengths (FL), the length from the fish’s nose to the fork of its tail, are measured from
imaging sonar data using vendor-provided, user-driven software (ARISFish by Sound Metrics Corp). Over
a 24-hour period, a total of 8 hours of imaging data are subsampled with 20 fish images randomly
selected for length measurements. This produces a total of 160 fork length measurements for each of
the hydroacoustic sampling areas. A mixture model is fitted to the resulting distribution of length data
to estimate the proportion of different species within the mixture (Figure 1). Three different estimation

145

In-season Assessments: Daily Abundance Estimates

methods can be used: maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), discriminant function analysis (DFA) and
single-value-threshold (SVT) method. The maximum likelihood method will require initial values for the
means and standard deviations for the individual distributions that make up the mixture. The resulting
model might fit the data but the individual distributions might not always make biological sense, e.g.
results may eliminate certain species such as jack Chinook even though there is evidence from the test
fishery that this age group of Chinook salmon should be present. The MLE method is especially prone to
errors when the sample size is small. The strength of the DFA method lies in the fact that the method
relies on Bayesian priors for the individual distributions, i.e. mean lengths and standard deviations. This
model therefore can produce results even when sample sizes are small but the resulting mixture model
might not fit the data very well. The SVT method uses length thresholds for the different species. It
works well when there is no overlap in the length distributions of the different species or when the
overlap is symmetrical. The larger the asymmetry in the overlap, the larger the bias in the SVT
proportion estimates. This method is least preferred but allows for verification of the other estimates.

Figure 1. Fit of the mixture model to length data from 3392 fish images acquired by ARIS from
July 9 to July 28, 2019 on the left bank over a range bin of 10 to 30 meter. The resulting mixture
model estimates 69% of the fish to be small resident fish, 22% are sockeye and 9% are Chinook
salmon.

SALMON SPECIES PROPORTIONS

A multitude of different species methods are used to derive daily sockeye and pink salmon abundance
estimates from the total daily salmon passage estimates (Table 1, Martens et al., 2019, Michielsens and
Cave, 2013). Traditionally, salmon species composition are derived from catch data collected by the
Whonnock test fishery with the proportions based on gilled and girthed catch. In case of low daily
salmon catch numbers (<15), catches also include tangled salmon. When catches are low, these
estimates are however very uncertain and highly variable. In addition, this method has some known
biases as pink salmon, who migrate primarily near-shore, tend to be less vulnerable to this test fishery,
resulting in an underestimate of pink salmon abundance. Chinook salmon on the other hand tend to
have a higher catchability, resulting in an overestimation of Chinook abundances. Similar analyses can
be done with the catch data from the Qualark test fishery. The resulting daily sockeye abundance

146

In-season Assessments: Daily Abundance Estimates

estimates can be considered minimum estimates of the abundance that passed the Mission site given
the fact that several sockeye stocks migrate past Mission but do not pass Qualark, i.e. Chilliwack (Early
Summers); Harrison (Summers); and Birkenhead, Big Silver, Weaver, and Cultus (Late run). For Chinook,
the daily abundance estimates at Qualark early in the season can be considered estimates of the
Chinook abundance at Mission given that the Chinook stocks that do not migrate past Qualark, i.e.
Chilliwack and Harrison, are later timed fall Chinook. The same concerns about assuming equal
catchability applies for this method. The catchability correction model aims to reduce the potential
biases due to differences in catchability by estimating a different catchability for the different salmon
species. In recent years, the correction to the resulting sockeye abundances have been limited to the
low sockeye catches.

An alternative estimate of daily sockeye abundance at Mission can be obtained by using sockeye CPUE
data from the Whonnock test fishery in combination with a historical expansion line estimate
(1/catchability). This method is regularly relied upon early in the season when no hydroacoustic data are
yet available, or in pink salmon years when daily salmon abundances are dominated by pink salmon
stocks. While the daily sockeye abundance estimates derived from CPUE data may differ substantially
from the hydroacoustic based sockeye abundance estimates when available, averaged over three days,
the CPUE based method produces similar abundance estimates unless catchability in a given year
deviates substantially from average. The Chinook CPUE data from the Albion test fishery can be
similarly used in combination with a historical expansion line estimate to derive daily Chinook
abundance estimates at Mission (Hawkshaw, 2018). In cases when salmon species are limited to sockeye
and Chinook salmon, the daily sockeye abundance can be estimated by subtracting the daily Chinook
abundance estimates from the total daily salmon estimates. Similar concerns remain about the
representativeness of the historical catchability estimates in the current year.

In the past, there has been clear evidence that the differences in catchability estimates can lead to
overestimated Chinook abundance estimates, whereby the sum of the daily reconstructed Chinook
abundance greatly exceeded the total post-season run size of Fraser River Chinook. To ensure daily
estimates are in-line with realistic total run size estimates for Chinook salmon, the preseason Chinook
run size forecasts of 6 different Chinook groups (Spring 1.2, Spring 1.3, Summer, 1.3, Summer 0.3,
Chilliwack and Harrison) are used in combination with the timing and spread of each stock group to
forecast daily Chinook abundances across the season and the associated uncertainty around those daily
estimates i.e. the 95% probability interval (Figure 2). In case no alternative species composition data are
available due to a lack of test fishing catches or if the resulting estimates are considered unreliable, the
median forecast of the daily Chinook abundance can be used to derive daily sockeye abundance
estimates. Alternatively, the upper 97.5% confidence limit can be used to cap the daily Chinook
abundance estimates derived from test fishing catch data. While it is possible to exceed the upper
confidence limit on a given day or several days, consistently exceeding this limit would require that
Chinook returns exceed the 97.5th percentile of the forecast.

forecasts for Spring 1.2, Spring 1.3, Summer, 1.3, Summer 0.3, Chilliwack and Harrison Chinook,
used in combination with migration timing and spread estimates.

In recent years, returns of Fraser River sockeye have been extremely low. As a result, the relative
sockeye abundance has decreased, and the importance of accurate species composition estimates
increased. The majority of the species composition methods discussed thus far rely on in-river test
fisheries whose catches decrease with decreasing abundances. In recent years, it has been especially
challenging to obtain catch data early in the season when abundances are lowest or for catches to be
sufficiently large to obtain desired sample sizes from which to derive species composition estimates.
Hydroacoustic length information has not experienced similar sample size challenges and the stratified
species composition method has been used to derive salmon species composition estimates. The
method is stratified as it relies on the hydroacoustic length information and the mixture model for the
species composition of the salmon abundance along the left and right bank and the Whonnock test
fishing catch data for the species composition in the midsection of the river. The mixture model
however performs best when the different species differ substantially in mean lengths which is the case
when distinguishing sockeye from resident fish. Pink and sockeye salmon are however more similar in
length and especially in years with larger pink salmon and smaller sockeye, the limited difference in
average lengths may result in increasingly uncertain species composition estimates. Alternatively, fish
wheel information can be used for the species composition along the shore.

Other methods exist to estimate in-river species composition and these are tracked but not used very
often given the large associated uncertainty. One of those methods relies on marine CPUE data of
Fraser River sockeye used in combination with an expansion line (Chapter B4). The resulting daily marine
abundance estimates can be used in a forward reconstruction to predict the number of sockeye within
the river. When using this method for species composition, only historical expansion lines can be used,
resulting in the larger uncertainty as using the in-season expansion line requires knowing the sockeye
abundance at Mission.

Early predictor of in-river abundances

While there exist many different methods to estimate species composition, they all have some
shortcomings that may substantially bias species composition estimates under certain conditions. In-
season, the different methods are run jointly, and the resulting sockeye, Chinook and pink salmon
abundances are compared. Concurrence in abundance estimates when relying on multiple different
methods will provide increased confidence in the use of species composition estimates derived from
those methods while deviation from other estimates will decrease an estimate’s credibility.

Planned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement
Improvement to the estimation of the species composition has been one of the recommendations
identified during the Hydroacoustic Review (Conrad et al., 2019). That review resulted in the
development of the catchability correction model. Currently, there are plans in place to further expand
the species composition methods by including a non-linear CPUE model and an integrated multi-species
model that would incorporate the various data sources. Species composition estimation can also be
improved by evaluating the performance of the different models. Thus far, the lack of known post-
season abundance estimates for the different species has prevented the use of retrospective analyses to

149

In-season Assessments: Daily Abundance Estimates

evaluate model performance. Alternatively, the bias and precision of the different methods could be
evaluated through simulations. Such a simulation study has been undertaken for the mixture model, but
this work has not yet been expanded to include the stratified version of the mixture model.

B17. In-season Application of Stock ID Information

E.S. Jenkins, F.J. Martens and C.G.J. Michielsens

Summary
Fraser River sockeye are managed by management group, as per the Pacific Salmon Treaty.
Therefore, stock proportion estimates must be applied to catches, in-season abundance indices,
and escapement estimates in order to split the data into the four current management groups.
Sockeye catch samples are taken from test fisheries (Chapter B5), as well as other fisheries
when available, and the mix of stocks within that sample is determined through scale and
genetic analyses (Chapter B8 and B9). The resulting stock proportion estimates are not only
used to determine the stock proportions of the total catch from which the sample was taken,
but are also assumed to represent the stock proportions of the sockeye that escaped the
fishery and continued their upstream migration. If no samples are taken to represent a
particular catch, then stock proportion estimates based on another catch (that best represents
that group of fish) are applied. The resulting stock-specific estimates of catch and escapement
past Mission are then used in further reconstructions to assess, for each management group,
the total run size in marine areas (Chapter B18), as well as the potential escapement to the
spawning grounds.

Introduction
According to the Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST 2020, Chapter 4, section 3), Fraser sockeye salmon stocks
are managed as part of four stock management groups: Early Stuart, Early Summer run, Summer run
and Late run. This stipulation within the treaty requires salmon catches and escapement abundance
estimates to be split into the four different stock aggregates corresponding with each of the four
different management groups.

PSC staff conduct sampling programs designed to identify stock proportions of Fraser River sockeye
salmon in marine areas as well as in the river. This is done by sampling the catches from test fisheries;
these samples are assumed to represent the stock composition of the available fish. The resulting stock
composition estimates are used in combination with daily abundance estimates obtained from in-river
hydroacoustic data (Chapter B10) and from marine catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) data (Chapter B2) to
derive daily abundance estimates by management group, both in marine areas as well as in the river.
Stock proportions are also applied to assign catches by the different fisheries (commercial, test,
Ceremonial & Subsistence (C&S), First Nations, and recreational fisheries) to different management
groups.

Stock proportion estimates are essential for reconstructions. For backwards reconstructions (Chapter
B18), the stock-specific daily escapement estimates past Mission are added to the stock-specific catch
abundances seaward of Mission, resulting in stock-specific daily marine abundance estimates. These
marine daily abundance estimates allow for assessment of the associated run size, either using time
density models (Chapter B19) when only part of the run has been observed in-season, or using the total
marine abundance when the entire run has been observed. Similarly, forward reconstructions using
stock-specific daily escapement estimates past Mission, in combination with stock-specific daily catch
abundance estimates upstream of Mission, allow for the prediction of the number of spawners expected
to reach the spawning grounds or other locations within the watershed (Qualark, for example).

151

In-season Assessments: Daily Abundance Estimates

Data
The data required for daily reconstructed abundance estimates include catch, escapement, and stock ID
(as well as the stock ID sample size). To derive time-series’ of stock-specific daily abundance estimates,
the daily estimate of total sockeye escapement past the hydroacoustic site at Mission is multiplied with
stock proportion estimates derived from catch samples. Stock-specific catch data are included for
backward reconstructions of the marine abundance estimates, as well as the forward reconstructions of
the potential spawning escapement. Further information on the derivation of daily abundance estimates
at Mission, daily catch information, and daily stock proportion estimates from catch samples can be
found in Chapters B10, B18, and B8, B9, respectively.

Currently, 20 different sockeye stocks are accounted for in the stock proportion estimates: 19 Fraser
River sockeye stocks and the remaining non-Fraser stocks, which are combined into one group (Chapter
B9). The majority of the samples analyzed using scale reading and DNA methods are obtained from test
fishing catches (Chapter B1). As a result, for each of the test fishing locations, there exist 20 time-series
of stock proportions covering the entire duration of a fishery. Additional catch samples from
commercial, C&S, First Nations, and recreational fisheries are also analyzed. However, the logistics of
collecting, transporting and analyzing samples from these additional fisheries in a timely fashion for in-
season assessments is complex, and the resulting time series of stock proportion estimates may not
cover all fisheries in all areas for their full duration. In addition, limited abundances and / or low salmon
catchability may result in sample sizes below the recommended 100 fish in marine area test fisheries
and 50 fish for in-river test fisheries. Therefore, the size of the sample from which the stock proportion
estimate has been derived is important for the successful application of stock proportion estimates. The
sample size helps to determine the uncertainty associated with an estimate; it can also indicate the
need to combine stock proportion estimates across multiple days.

Methods
Stock proportion estimates are applied to both abundance and catch estimates. It is important that the
stock proportion estimates are applied to all days and areas associated with the abundance time series,
not only the days on which the catch was taken or for the fisheries from which the catch was taken.
There are several options to estimate stock proportions when no sample was taken or analyzed on a
given day or for a particular area. Stock proportions can be borrowed from a previous or following day,
interpolated between days before and after, or borrowed from a nearby fishery. In cases where
information from other fisheries is used, the date of the information is offset to reflect the time required
for the sockeye to migrate between the two fishing areas, therefore ensuring that the stock proportion
information from the other fishing area reflects the same block or group of fish. In cases where a sample
size is much smaller than the recommended amount, the samples for several days may be combined
and the resulting stock proportions applied to the catches on all of the days included in the sample.
Especially in the river, limited sample sizes can be a serious issue, and requiring more complex methods
to combine stock proportion information from various samples.

Once stock proportion time series’ have been completed and cover all days, areas, and fisheries for
which abundance estimates or catch data are available, they can be multiplied to generate stock-specific
daily abundances and catch estimates (Figure 1). These stock-specific estimates can be summed by
management group and across days to generate management-group-specific estimates of abundance
and catch to date. In addition, the stock-specific daily estimates can also be used within backward
reconstructions to generate stock-specific daily marine abundance estimates, or within forward
reconstructions to calculate stock-specific daily abundance estimates expected to reach the spawning
grounds (Chapter B18).

catch data. Used within reconstruction models, it allows the generation of stock-specific daily abundance estimates
in marine areas (to be used for run-size assessment purposes) and at the spawning grounds (to be compared
against spawning escapement targets). Processes are represented by blue rectangles and resulting estimates by
green rectangles with rounded corners.

Planned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement
Currently, 20 different sockeye stock groups are accounted for by the stock proportion estimates and
the files associated with the assignment of stock proportion estimates to catch and escapement data are
therefore called the CR20 files (Catch and Racial files for 20 groups). Based on DNA stock ID methods,
the number of groups can be expanded to close to 90, and a new set of CR files has been created to
account for this expansion: CR100 files. While it is not advisable to use the estimates in the CR100 files
at their finest resolution, storing the data at this level ensures increased flexibility in terms of grouping
the different stocks and ‘rolling-up’ the estimates according to the different groupings. In addition, the
CR100 files include several non-Fraser stock groups rather than combining them into one group.
Currently, a database is being created that would store the data from the CR100 files. Once completed

153

In-season Assessments: Daily Abundance Estimates

this database will allow flexible, multi-year queries to be performed on the catch and escapement data
by stock and management group, and estimates to be rolled up in a variety of ways, including
temporally, geographically, etc. In the future, we might also switch to using the CR100 files in-season.

B18. In-season Marine Reconstructions

M.J. Hague and C.G.J. Michielsens

Summary
Run reconstructions are a key tool for fisheries stock assessment and allow biologists to
combine catch and escapement data to estimate daily abundances and annual run size. The
Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) is responsible for developing and applying run reconstruction
models for Fraser River sockeye salmon as well as disseminating and archiving the resulting
estimates. In-season reconstructions are applied both forward and backwards. Forward
reconstructions predict stock-specific escapement into the river based on marine daily
abundances derived from stock-specific catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data from marine test
fisheries (Chapter B2) combined with assumptions about migration speed and delay behaviour.
Backward reconstructions add stock-specific daily estimates of marine and lower river catches
to stock-specific daily escapement estimates (Chapter B10) to reconstruct the total daily
abundance in marine areas. The estimates are used to derive time series of marine timing,
migration spread and diversion rate. Backward reconstructions also allow to update in-season
test fishing catchability estimates (Chapter B4). The following report describes the basic
structure and underlying assumptions of the reconstruction model, and the time series it
generates.

Introduction
Management of Fraser River sockeye salmon fundamentally relies on accurate estimates of run size (for
deriving the amount of total allowable catch (TAC)), and migration behavior (to determine how to access
the TAC). As part of the Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST) agreements (PST 2020, Chapter 4, paragraph 13(a)),
Commission staff are responsible for providing in-season updates to Fraser River sockeye salmon run
size, timing, and diversion rate.

Run reconstructions have been a key tool for salmon fisheries management for over 80 years; their
application first thoroughly described by Starr and Hilborn (1988). PSC Secretariat Staff are responsible
for developing and applying run reconstruction models for Fraser River sockeye (Cave and Gazey 1994)
and archiving their results. Within these reconstruction models, stock-specific daily marine and lower
river catches are added to stock-specific daily escapement estimates obtained by the PSC hydroacoustic
facility (Conrad et al. 2019) to reconstruct daily abundances as the salmon run as it approaches the
marine areas around Vancouver Island. In-season, daily reconstructed abundances are used to provide
the best in-season estimate of run-size, timing, and diversion for Fraser River sockeye populations,
either directly from the reconstructed abundance or when used within in-season assessment models
(Michielsens and Cave 2018), project abundances of fish expected to be available to different fisheries,
and update test fishery catchability estimates (Chapter B4).

After the fishing season concludes, reconstructions are used to update several time series of sockeye
migration behaviour, including marine timing (date when 50% of a run has passed through marine
areas), northern diversion (percent of a run migrating through Johnstone Strait), spread (number of days
comprising 95% of the marine migration), and delay (days holding off the mouth of the Fraser River in
the Straight of Georgia). In addition, Canada relies on historical time series of run size, timing, and
diversion to generate pre-season forecasts (Chapters A1 and A2) which are critical inputs for pre-season
planning and simulations (Cave and Gazey 1994, Chapter A6 and A7) and are also used as informative

priors in Bayesian in-season run size models (Michielsens and Cave 2018, Chapter B19). In addition,
historical run reconstructions are used in retrospective evaluations of fishery harvest rates (PSC 1995)
and to develop decision rules for updating in-season test fishery catchability coefficients (Chapter B4).

Data
The key data used to reconstruct daily marine abundances along the Johnstone Strait and Juan de Fuca
route are: test fishery catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data (Chapter B2), test fishery catchability (Chapter
B4), landed catches, Mission daily abundances (Chapter B10) and stock identification (Chapter B9). To
populate the reconstruction model, information is also required regarding migration distances between
fishery areas and the river, as well as assumed migration rates (Hague et al. 2019). Summer run sockeye
are assumed to migrate a distance of 257km in 6-days, corresponding to an average daily migration rate
of 43km/day between the Area 20 purse seine test fishing location and the Mission hydroacoustic site.
Late-timed sockeye are assumed to take an average of 8-days, covering 32km/day, to make the same
journey.

Methods
The box-car run reconstruction model assumes salmon move in groups, i.e., box-cars, from the marine
areas to the Fraser River through a series of fisheries that will impact the number of salmon in a group
(Cave and Gazey 1996). The assessment of Fraser River sockeye relies on two different reconstruction
approaches: backward reconstruction and forward reconstruction, and both are used to assess Fraser
River sockeye salmon (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Schematic illustration of a basic box-car run reconstruction model. The colored bars
represent different statistical fishing areas, with the left most square representing the most
seaward location. Each “fish/hook” represents one day of fishing. Each fish represents one daily
block of fish. Black fish in each panel are not exposed to a fishery opening on a given day, while
grey fish are. Each panel represents a daily time-step. The top panel represents the shape of the
unfished run prior to entering marine approach fisheries. The bottom panel represents the shape
of the run at Mission, with certain days of abundance reduced due to catch removals.

In-season Assessments: Daily Abundance Estimates

The backwards box-car reconstruction is used to estimate total daily marine abundances by adding
seaward catches (C) onto daily abundance estimates (N) at Mission. To simplify the reconstruction, dates
(d) associated with the daily catch report (the catch date) from each fishery (f) in each statistical area (A)
and the daily abundance data at Mission (the upstream migration date) are adjusted to the date
associated with a geographical reference point. For the reconstruction and assessment of Fraser River
sockeye salmon the reference point used is the site of the Area 20 purse seine test fishery located at the
seaward entrance of Juan de Fuca Strait. The dates associated with the data from other areas are
adjusted based on the amount of time (rounded to the day) it takes for sockeye to migrate to these
areas from the reference point. Assuming it takes 6 days for Summer run sockeye to migrate between
Area 20 (A20) and Mission (AMission) implies a 6 day offset (oA20, Mission) that would result in the Area 20 date
(dA20) associated with abundance estimates at Mission (NMission) to be 6 days earlier than the actual date:

(1)

 𝑁𝑑𝐴20,𝐴𝑀𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝑁(𝑑−𝑜𝐴20,𝑀𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛),𝐴𝑀𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛

= 𝑁(𝑑−6),𝐴𝑀𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛.

The same assumptions about migration speeds and associated offsets are also made for the sockeye
migrating through Johnstone Strait. For example, it takes about 7 days to migrate from the Area 12
purse seine test fishing site to Mission, resulting in an offset of -1, making the corresponding Area 20
date for catches caught by purse seine test fishery (fPS,TF) in the Area 12 (A12) one day later than the
actual date:

(2)

𝐶𝑑𝐴20,𝑓𝑃𝑆,𝑇𝐹,𝐴12 = 𝐶(𝑑−𝑜𝐴20,𝐴12),𝑓𝑃𝑆,𝑇𝐹,𝐴12

= 𝐶(𝑑+1),𝑓𝑃𝑆,𝑇𝐹,𝐴12.

The following description assumes that all the dates associated with the data have already been
adjusted to the correspond to the Area 20 reference date. Also, the reconstruction is implemented for
individual stocks (s) but this has been omitted from the descriptions to simplify the equations.
Information on the application of stock ID within the reconstructions can be found in Chapter B17.

In addition to adjusting all dates to a common reference date, reported catch data that may include
catches across several ‘blocks’ of fish (due to the large size of the statistical area for which they are
reported) are spread across n migration days depending on the fishery and the statistical area so that
the sum of the catch proportions (pn) equals the total catch reported:

(3)

𝐶𝑑20,𝑓,𝐴 = ∑ 𝑝𝑛 ∙

𝐶𝑑20−𝑛+1,𝑓,𝐴.
For the actual backward reconstruction, all the daily seaward catches along both approach routes are
added to the daily Mission passage estimates to reconstruct the total daily abundance (𝑁𝑑𝐴20) at the
entry of the marine fishing areas:

𝑛
1

(4)

𝑁𝑑𝐴20 = 𝑁𝑑𝐴20,𝐴𝑀𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 + ∑ 𝐶𝑑𝐴20,𝑓,𝐴.

In-season, forward reconstructions are used that remove the daily catches between the marine area and
Mission from the daily marine abundance estimates to predict daily abundances at Mission.

(5)

𝑁𝑑𝐴20,𝐴𝑀𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛

= 𝑁𝑑𝐴20 − ∑ 𝐶𝑑𝐴20,𝑓,𝐴.

In this case, the daily marine reconstruction estimates are based on test fishery CPUE data (Chapter B2),
used in combination with catchability estimates (Chapter B4). CPUE-based marine abundances and the
derived Mission abundances are important in-season as they provide an early indication of abundances
prior to fish arriving at Mission. Both gillnet and purse seine CPUE data are relied upon in-season. Each
day, the marine reconstruction model allows stock assessment biologists to select which test fisheries to
rely upon as well as to average estimates when data from more than one test fishery are available for a
particular area. Within the reconstruction files, marine test fishery CPUE data are also combined with
reconstructed abundances from Mission to provide in-season updated catchability estimates (Chapter
B4). This further allows the selection of catchability estimates for the different test fisheries in the

157

In-season Assessments: Daily Abundance Estimates

reconstruction, i.e. rely on historical pre-season expansion lines or a variety of different in-season and
adjusted in-season expansion lines depending on the available test fishery data.

DERIVED TIME SERIES

Both forward and backward reconstructions are essential to derive additional time series of diversion
through Johnstone Strait, the proportion of Late run delaying its upstream migration, the timing of the
run and the spread.

The daily (northern) diversion rate estimates, i.e. the proportion of the total daily estimate migrating
through Johnstone Strait, are based on CPUE data from test fisheries operating in Juan de Fuca and
Johnstone Straits (Putman et al. 2014).

The reconstruction is also used to derive daily estimates of delaying Late run and Harrison stocks
(Lapointe et al. 2003). Delaying Fraser River sockeye stocks are defined as holding in the Strait of
Georgia for an extended number of days (or weeks) prior to redistributing and migrating upstream,
resulting in a roughly bi-model distribution. Instead of using Mission passage to update test fishing
catchability estimates for delaying stocks, the difference between marine abundances and upstream
escapement is used to estimate the number of salmon delaying their upstream migration. The quality of
these predictions will depend on the quality of the CPUE-based daily abundance estimates. Post-season,
the estimates of delay can be improved by rescaling the CPUE-based abundances so that the total of
CPUE-based daily abundances equals the total post-season run size, i.e. the sum of the total
reconstructed daily abundance estimates at Mission plus seaward catch. It should be noted that in the
case of delaying stocks, it is not possible to run the backward reconstruction as the box-car movement
assumption is broken and the Mission escapement and catches cannot be aligned with seaward
abundances.

The reconstructed daily abundance time series are also used to derive estimates of timing and spread.
The marine migration date, also referred to as the Area 20 date or marine 50% date, indicate the date
when half (50%) of the run would have passed through Area 20 assuming all fish migrated via that route.
The spread is defined as the number of days of migration comprising 95% of the run.

These historical time series are used in forecasting models (Chapter A2) that set pre-season
expectations, allow for the prediction of fisheries impacts (Chapter A6 and A9) and serve as informative
prior probability distribution inputs into the in-season stock assessment models (Michielsens and Cave
2019, Chapter B19).

Planned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement
More complex post-season reconstruction files are already in development, with increased stock
resolution, improved flexibility and transparency in migration assumptions, and the ability to reconstruct
abundance time series to multiple locations of interest (Hague et al. 2019). The post-season files also
incorporate additional information and a more complex series of decision rules to derive marine
abundances used in forward reconstructions and for delaying stock groups. While several of these
improvements are only possible post-season, the ability to reconstruct time series to key index locations
would improve the capacity for evaluating route-specific catches and abundances as well as generate
projections of species and stock-specific encounter rates in-season.

B19. In-season Time-density Model

C.G.J. Michielsens

Summary
The in-season assessment of Fraser River sockeye salmon relies on the Bayesian
implementation of a time-density model to estimate run size and associated run timing. This
model is fit to available catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data from gill net test fisheries in statistical
fishing Areas 12 and 20, purse seine data in Areas 12, 13 and 20 (Chapter B2), and
reconstructed daily abundance estimates derived from hydroacoustic data collected at Mission
(Chapter B10) and seaward catches. The model relies on prior probability distributions of run
size, timing, standard deviation (or spread), diversion rate, and test fishery catchability based
on pre-season forecasts or historical observations (Chapters A1 and A2). Updated posterior
distributions are produced by the model for timing, abundance, diversion, and sometimes
spread, but the catchability priors are not updated. Instead, the daily catchabilities are assumed
to be fixed but uncertain inputs, based initially on historical estimates, and later on in-season
observations as they become available (Chapter B4). Early in-season, the model tends to
underestimate the number of days for the salmon to pass through marine areas, and therefore
the standard deviation of the migration (spread) is also considered a fixed but uncertain
parameter. If necessary, this assumption can be relaxed after the peak of the run has been
observed. The model is applied to stock aggregates which share similar migration timing and
fall within the same management groups. For stocks that delay their upstream migration, only
marine CPUE are used to assess the run, resulting in larger run size uncertainty in comparison
to stocks that also rely on marine reconstructed data.

Introduction
The Fraser River Panel is responsible for the in-season management of Fraser River sockeye stocks, as
stipulated by the Pacific Salmon Treaty between Canada and the United States (PSC in-season). Under
the terms of the Treaty, Commission staff are responsible for providing the Panel and Technical
Committee with in-season updates of run size. Historically, two different methods had been relied upon
for the in-season assessment of salmon stocks: regression models relating indicators of abundance (or
cumulative abundance) on a given date with total run-size estimates obtained post-season (Fried and
Hilborn 1988, Ryall 1998) and time-density (or cumulative time-density) models that estimate the
proportion of the migration on a given date (Walters and Buckingham 1975, PSC 1995, Springborn et al.
1998). These time-density models rely on the date of peak abundance as well as the shape of the daily
abundance profile over time. They can be fit to abundance indices such as catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE)
data from commercial or test fisheries, as well as absolute estimates of abundance reconstructed from
catch and real-time escapement data.

While time-density models have the advantage that the timing of the migration is an estimated model
parameter compared to a fixed input as is the case for alternative in-season assessment models that rely
on regression analyses using catch or CPUE (PSC 1995, Ryall 1998), the simultaneous estimation of
timing and run size can also pose some challenges. The peak of the run can only be confirmed once
more than 50% of the migration has been observed. Consequently, prior to the peak, runs that are small
and early or late and large may be indistinguishable (Adkison and Cunningham 2015). The integration of
all available sources of data and information within the assessments is therefore important to ensure

160

timely in-season management decisions. Bayesian methods offer an ideal platform for such analyses
while also accounting for the uncertainty in the resulting estimates (Fried and Hilborn 1988, Hyun et al.
2005). This document describes a general time-density model developed in a Bayesian framework for
the in-season assessment of run size and timing for Fraser River sockeye salmon.

Data
The in-season assessment of Fraser River sockeye stocks relies on four types of data: Lower Fraser River
daily abundance estimates from the hydroacoustic program at Mission, catches seaward of the
hydroacoustics program, test fishing catch and effort, and stock identification data (Woodey 1987). The
reduced allowable exploitation of Fraser River sockeye in recent years has increased the reliance on test
fishing CPUE information rather than commercial data as an index of abundance. The main marine test
fisheries for in-season assessments are the gill net and purse seine test fisheries in DFO statistical Areas
12 and 13 (Johnstone Strait), and Area 20 (Juan de Fuca Strait). The combined CPUE data from these two
Straits provide time series of relative daily abundance. Reconstructed estimates of daily absolute
abundance in the same areas are derived through backward reconstruction methods (Starr and Hilborn
1988) using upstream daily passage estimates by the Mission hydroacoustics program in combination
with seaward catches (Chapter B18). Both the CPUE and the reconstructed data are multiplied by stock
proportion estimates (Chapter B17) to produce multiple timeseries resolved at finer stock resolutions.
Separate models are then parameterized for stock aggregates within each management group that have
distinctly different migration timing, catchability, or migration behaviour (e.g. delay or non-delay). To
simplify the model description within this report, stock indices have been omitted from the model
equations.

In-season, the marine CPUE data are considered early indicators of the expected daily abundance at
Mission 6-days later, as it takes Fraser sockeye approximately 6-days to travel from the marine test
fishery locations to the hydroacoustic site at Mission. Therefore, in-season, there is a 6-day lag between
CPUE and reconstructed timeseries. In addition, reconstructed marine abundance estimates are only
available for stocks that do not delay their upstream migration into the Fraser River due to the violation
of basic reconstruction assumptions (Chapter B18). For stocks like Harrison and delaying Late run stocks,
only marine CPUE data can be used to assess these stocks, resulting in larger run size uncertainty.

Methods
The following model description assumes that all timeseries have been offset in order to align with a
single geographical reference location associated with the Area 20 purse seine test fishing site (Chapter
B18). Date indices corresponding to data from all other locations are adjusted accordingly based on the
relative difference in assumed fish migration time between Area 20 and Mission, and the migration time
between the location of interest and Mission. For example, it takes approximately 7-days for sockeye to
migrate from the Area 12 purse seine test fishing site to Mission, making the corresponding Area 20
date for the CPUE data of the purse seine test fishery in Area 12 one day later than the actual date. All
dates mentioned in the description of the time-density model below refer to Area 20 dates.

IN-SEASON TIME-DENSITY MODEL

The in-season time-density model to assess the run size and timing of different Fraser River sockeye
groups relies on a time-density function to represent the daily salmon migration past the marine test
fishing locations (Mundy 1979, Cave and Gazey 1994, Springborn et al. 1998). Two different versions of
the time-density model are used depending on the available test fishing data and the associated quality.
The marine gill net data are of lower quality as a relative index of abundance compared to the purse
seine data given the substantially lower catchability of sockeye salmon by gill nets versus purse seines,

161

In-season Assessments: Run size assessment

i.e., they catch a much smaller proportion of the run. The marine gill net data are however essential for
the assessment of early-timed, low abundance stocks for which the cost of running expensive purse
seine test fisheries would be prohibitive. Given the high variability in the individual gill net CPUE time-
series for the Area 12 and 20, the two time-series are combined into a total CPUE time-series to assess
the combined abundance migrating through marine areas. In cases where purse seine CPUE data are
available, a more detailed version of the model assesses the abundance in both approaches separately.
The following paragraphs will first describe the model using marine gill net data, followed by a
description of a more complex model version incorporating data from both gear types.

The daily abundance of salmon (Nd) passing the marine reference locations on a given day d can be
represented as:

(1)

𝑁𝑑 = 𝑁 ∙ 𝑓(𝑑)

where f(d) is the time-density function of migrating salmon, i.e., the daily proportion of the total run size
and N is the total run size or the total recruitment of salmon, available to coastal fisheries. For Fraser
sockeye, we assume a normal distribution of migrating salmon over time (Gilhousen 1960, Cave and
Gazey 1994):

𝐼𝑑,𝐺𝑁 = 𝑞𝑑,𝐺𝑁 ∙ 𝑁𝑑

where q represents the catchability coefficient, i.e., the proportion of the daily abundance taken as
catch by one unit of effort. The observed CPUE data differ from the model predictions assuming
lognormal residual errors:

(5)

𝑜𝑏𝑠 = 𝐼𝑑,𝐺𝑁 ∙ 𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑤𝑑,𝐺𝑁)
𝐼𝑑,𝐺𝑁

with 𝑤𝑑,𝐺𝑁~𝑁(0, 𝜎𝑤,𝐺𝑁

).

In cases when purse seine test fishery data are available in addition to gill net data, the time-density
model is expanded to include daily abundance estimates in Johnstone as well as Juan de Fuca Strait:

(6)

𝑁𝑑,𝐴12 = 𝑁 ∙ 𝐷 ∙ 𝑓(𝑑)  and 𝑁𝑑,𝐴20 = 𝑁 ∙ (1 − 𝐷) ∙ 𝑓(𝑑)

where Nd,a is the daily abundance on a given day d in area a (A12 or A20), and D is the (northern)
diversion rate, i.e. the proportion of the run migrating through Johnstone Strait (A12) (Chapter A2). For
gill net test fisheries, it is assumed that the sockeye catchability is the same in Johnstone Strait versus
Juan de Fuca Strait. Therefore the Gill net CPUE on a given day (Id,GN) is:

(7)

𝐼𝑑,𝐺𝑁 = 𝑞𝑑,𝐺𝑁 ∙ (𝑁𝑑,𝐴12 + 𝑁𝑑,𝐴20).

For purse seine test fisheries, it is assumed that the catchability depends on the relative width of the
area swept or sampled, i.e., the width of the migratory channel at the test fishing site in relation to the
size of the fishing net. Because the relative width of the area swept in Juan de Fuca Strait is 2.2 times
larger than in Johnstone Strait, it is assumed that the sockeye catchability of the purse seine test fishery
in Area 12 is 2.2 times greater than in Area 20. Similarly, the catchability in Area 13 is assumed to be 1.5

162

In-season Assessments: Run size assessment

times greater than in Area 12, or 3.3 times greater than in Area 20. The purse seine CPUE on a given day
in the Area 12, 20 and 13 (Id,PS,a) is therefore respectively:

(8)

(9)

𝐼𝑑,𝑃𝑆,𝐴20 = 𝑞𝑑,𝑃𝑆,𝐴20 ∙ 𝑁𝑑,𝐴20,

𝐼𝑑,𝑃𝑆,𝐴12 = 2.2 ∙ 𝑞𝑑,𝑃𝑆,𝐴20 ∙ 𝑁𝑑,𝐴12, and

(10)

𝐼𝑑,𝑃𝑆,𝐴13 = 3.3 ∙ 𝑞𝑑,𝑃𝑆,𝐴20 ∙ (𝑁𝑑,𝐴12 − 𝐶𝑑,𝐴12)

where Cd,A12 is the total catch taken between Area 12 and 13 on a given day. The observed CPUE data for
the different test fisheries (f) differ from the model predictions assuming lognormal residual errors:

BAYESIAN IMPLEMENTATION INCORPORATING PRIOR KNOWLEDGE

The time-density model described above requires the simultaneous estimation of total run size (N),
2 and
timing of the migration (T), the diversion rate (D), and the variances of the residual error terms (𝜎𝑣
2 ). For several of the model parameters, additional information is available to formulate informative
𝜎𝑤
prior probability distributions which can be incorporated using a Bayesian estimation approach (Gelman
et al. 1995). The prior probability distributions for run size, timing and diversion rate are based on the
pre-season forecasts (Chapters A1 and A2). The assumed distributions for run size, timing and diversion
rates are respectively a lognormal, normal and beta distribution (Table 1). The normal prior probability
distribution for the standard deviation of the migration (S) is based on historical data. Because early in-
season, the model tends to underestimate the spread of the migration (i.e. the number of days it takes
for the 95% of the run to pass through the marine test fishing areas), this model parameter is considered
fixed but uncertain by default. However, this model parameter can be estimated if in-season data clearly
indicates a strong deviation from historical standard deviations.

For the catchability coefficient (q), a normal prior probability distribution is assumed for the inverse of
the catchability coefficient (q-1), i.e., the expansion line. At the start of the season, the prior probability
distributions for the gill net and purse seine expansion lines are based on historical data, but later in the
season, these distributions are based on in-season observations (Chapter B4). Unlike other prior
probability distributions, these distributions for expansion lines are not further updated by the model.
Uninformative gamma distributions are used as priors for the residual error terms (𝜎𝑣

2 and 𝜎𝑤

2 ).

Figure 1 provides a graphical overview of the Bayesian time-density model as described above. This
model was developed and is run in WinBUGS 1.4 (Spiegelhalter et al. 2003) and called from the
statistical software package R (R Core Team 2013). All the model results undergo diagnostics to remove
the impact of initial MCMC samples, to eliminate the negative impact of autocorrelation within the
MCMC chains and to ensure convergence (Best et al. 1995). We assume the reported statistics of the
posterior probability distributions represent the true underlying distributions.

Figure 1. Graphical overview of the Bayesian time-density model when applied for the in-season
assessment of Fraser River sockeye. Prior probability distributions (A) based on preseason
forecasts of run size, migration timing and standard deviation of the migration allow the
prediction of the daily abundance of salmon assuming a normal distribution of migrating salmon
over time (B). Reconstructed daily marine abundance estimates and marine test fishery CPUE
data are collected and updated continuously throughout the salmon migration (C) and the model
predicted daily abundance estimates are fitted to these data. Relative abundance estimates such
as CPUE data however require an additional model parameter, in this case a catchability
estimate. The uncertainty in daily abundance estimates derived from CPUE data is therefore
represented using boxplots. Comparing the model predictions against the data allows the model
to derive the posterior probability distributions of the model parameters (A). To simplify this
figure, the probability distribution for the diversion rate and the variance parameters have been
omitted.

B20. In-season SMURF Model

S. Latham and C.G.J. Michielsens

Summary
The in-season assessment of run size and associated run timing of Fraser River sockeye salmon
consists primarily of the Bayesian implementation of a time-density model (Chapter B19). This
model relies on reconstructed daily abundance estimates (Chapter B18), which are initially
based on marine test fishery data until, six days later, these preliminary estimates can be
replaced by daily hydroacoustic estimates of migration past Mission (plus seaward catch). For
Late-run stocks, which delay and redistribute prior to migration into the Fraser River, it is not
possible to replace the daily estimates from test fishing with daily hydroacoustic-based
estimates, and this leads to larger in-season run size uncertainty. To ameliorate impacts of this
uncertainty when assessing Late-run stocks and fill the Late-run information gap when making
in-season management decisions, an alternative abundance-prediction method (SMURFing, i.e.,
Smolt Method of Updating Run Forecasts) was developed. This method relies on in-season
estimates of early-returning stocks to predict abundances of later-returning stocks, assuming
equal post-smolt marine survival among stocks. This method takes advantage of juvenile
sampling programs and stock compositions of seaward-migrating juveniles produced by those
programs. To the degree that relative abundances are the same in returning adults as in the
outmigrating juveniles, the estimated returns of earlier stocks are predictive of the returns of
later stocks. During dominant Shuswap return years, this method is applied to predict the
abundance of Late Shuswap/Portage from in-season run-size estimates of Early Thompson in
combination with estimates of relative abundance from the juvenile outmigration. Uncertainty
in juvenile stock compositions and in-season run size estimates for Early Thompson stocks
contribute to uncertainty in the predicted run size for Late Shuswap/Portage, as do potential
violations of assumptions.

Introduction
Due to extreme interannual variability in marine survival, return strengths of Fraser River sockeye have
been highly unpredictable in recent years. For example, recruits per effective female spawner varied
from less than 1 in the 2005 brood year to more than 12 in the 2006 brood year (DFO 2018), resulting in
returns below the 10th percentile and above the 90th percentile in pre-season forecasts in 2009 and
2010, respectively. Due to such variability, the prediction intervals of forecasts have broadened,
reducing their utility for effective fishery planning, and intensifying demand for accurate and timely in-
season assessments of abundance. For example, in 2018, the 80% probability interval for the total
return of Fraser River sockeye was 5 - 37 million (see Chapter A1).

The challenge of forecasting Fraser sockeye abundance in the pre-season has necessitated an intense in-
season assessment program, and run sizes are typically estimated with time-density models. These
models rely on the date of peak abundance and the shape of the daily abundance profile over time
(Chapter B19). The daily marine abundance estimates are derived through reconstructions (Chapter
B18) and are initially based on test fishery data. Once the salmon migrate into the Fraser River and pass
the hydroacoustic site at Mission, these initial estimates are replaced with hydroacoustic-based
estimates for most stocks. Unfortunately, some Late run stocks delay and redistribute prior to migration
into the river, making it impossible to replace the uncertain test fishing-based estimates. In addition, in-

167

In-season Assessments: Run size assessment

season run-size estimation using the time-density model is only possible when 50% of the run has been
observed. Prior to the peak, runs that are small and early or late and large may be indistinguishable
(Adkison and Cunningham 2015). As a result, management is under-informed about Late-run sockeye
when making fisheries management decisions. Other information, however, may be available to help
bridge this gap.

Stock proportions are important for planning fisheries in their own right, with respect to impacts on
non-target stocks. In addition, the relative abundances they represent are somewhat less difficult to
predict than absolute abundances (run sizes), reflecting positive correlation in productivity amongst
stocks (Latham and Michielsens 2022). Broad regional correspondence in productivity trends emphasize
the important role of factors impacting survival in coastal areas where the stocks share similar
environments early in their marine lives (Mueter et al. 2002). To take advantage of correlated marine
survival, a ‘Smolt Method of Updating Run Forecasts’ (SMURF) was developed that uses the in-season
run size estimates of an earlier-returning ‘Reference Stock’ and the ratio among stocks in out-migrant
juveniles to provide an in-season run-size estimate of the later-returning ‘Predicted Stock’. This estimate
is both independent of the pre-season forecast and available before traditional in-season run-size
updates for the Predicted Stock. As described below, this method helps to fill the information gap
between the pre-season forecast and the in-season time-density model results that become available
after the peak of the run has been observed.

Data
The model for SMURFing requires at least two highly processed data inputs: (i) relative stock
composition estimates among outmigrant juveniles (smolts or post-smolts) captured two years prior to
the year of return, and (ii) in-season estimates of the run size of 2-ocean sockeye from a Reference Stock
in the year of return. Stock compositions are estimated for outmigrating juveniles with DNA as in
Beacham et al. (2004). Run size for a Reference Stock is generally estimated using a time-density model
(Chapter B19) or reconstruction-based (Chapter B18), but also alternate estimates of run size can be
used, e.g., terminal hydroacoustics for Chilliwack sockeye on the 2020 cycle line. If stock composition
estimates (Chapter B9) used in generating daily abundances and run-size estimates for the Reference
Stock use the same method as for the juvenile stock composition, biases inherent in the method may be
at least partially offset.

Stock compositions of returning adults are estimated mostly from catches in Statistical Areas 12, 13, 20,
and 29 (Chapter B5). Samples of outmigrating juveniles can be collected from multiple locations,
including lake outlets, river main stems, or marine locations where a high proportion of the
outmigration passes during a short period of time (e.g., the Discovery Islands in Areas 12 and 13, Neville
et al. 2016). The latter may be preferable (Latham and Michielsens 2022), but more replicates across
years should be obtained to test that idea. For returns in 2018, juvenile samples were collected in 2016
from (i) the Mission downstream trap operated by DFO (Mahoney et al. 2013), (ii) salmon trawl and
seine programs operated by DFO in Areas 12-16 (Neville et al. 2016), and (iii) hand-operated seine
sampling conducted in Areas 12 and 13 by Hakai Institute (Johnson et al. 2019). Resulting genotypes
were graciously shared with the PSC Secretariat by these organizations.

SMURFing could theoretically be used in many circumstances but could be most beneficial in predicting
in-season run size of later-timed stocks that (i) are important for fisheries management considerations,
and (ii) are difficult to estimate in a timely manner using traditional time-density methods or other
methods. The Late run on Shuswap dominant years is a prime example, due to the effects of their
migration delay and redistribution as described above (Chapter B18). It is important for fisheries
management to obtain early in-season run-size estimates for these Late-run stocks, and even more so
given the overlap in migration between management groups. Therefore, in-season run-size estimates of
168

In-season Assessments: Run size assessment

Early Thompson are used in combination with relative juvenile abundance estimates of Early Thompson
in comparison to Late Shuswap/Portage to produce early in-season Late-run run size estimates.

In-season age composition estimates are additional data inputs required for some applications of this
method. As most Fraser River sockeye are 2-ocean fish upon their return, stock proportions of smolts
and post-smolts two years earlier are most like stock proportions among returning adults. For Early
Thompson and Late Shuswap/Portage on Shuswap dominant cycle years, the proportion of other ages is
negligible. With other years or other stocks, however, the proportion of 2-ocean individuals in both the
Reference Stock and the Predicted Stock must be estimated from scale samples from sockeye identified
to those stocks using DNA in-season. The abundance of 2-ocean sockeye in the Reference Stock predicts
the abundance of 2-ocean sockeye in the Predicted Stock, with the latter scaled-up to represent the
return of all ages. In-season age estimates are derived from scales collected and analyzed at the PSC
Secretariat Office (Chapter B7).

Methods
Depending upon several critical assumptions, in-season estimation of earlier-returning stocks can, in
combination with the ratio between earlier stocks and later stocks among out-migrating juveniles, be
used to produce a quantitative prediction regarding the abundance of later-returning stocks. Of the
various assumptions made when using this method, the most critical are the assumptions of equal
catchability of juveniles among stocks and equal survivability among stocks between the juvenile
sampling period and recruitment to adulthood. That is, SMURFing requires unbiased, representative
samples of the post-smolt stock proportions, and it requires that those proportions are the same when
the sockeye return to the Fraser River. The method makes other assumptions, but violations of those
other assumptions (e.g., equivalent maturity schedules in the Reference Stock and Predicted Stock) are
more amenable to study and estimated to have a relatively minor impact. A more complete list and
evaluation of assumptions can be found in Latham and Michielsens (2022). Violations of most
assumptions are expected to be reduced among stocks with juveniles that smolt at similar sizes and
follow similar migration routes on similar dates.

The following paragraphs provide a detailed description of the model as it was applied to assess the run
size of Late Shuswap/Portage in 2018. The model assumed that the abundance (N) of Late
Shuswap/Portage (LShP) stocks versus Early Thompson (ETho) stocks was the same, in a relative sense,
for post-smolt juveniles (J) as for returning adult recruits (R):

=

The ratio of post-smolt abundances could be rewritten as:

with pETho representing the proportion of Early Thompson post-smolts from the combined sample of
post-smolts from Early Thompson, Late Shuswap/Portage. Equation 1 could then be re-written as

(15)  𝑁𝑅,𝐿𝑆ℎ𝑃 = 𝑁𝑅,𝐸𝑇ℎ𝑜 ∙ ((1 − 𝑝𝐸𝑇ℎ𝑜) 𝑝𝐸𝑇ℎ𝑜

)

with NR,ETho being the in-season run size for Early Thompson, and NR,LShP the in-season run size for Late
Shuswap/Portage.

Early during the in-season management period, the run size of Early Thompson was derived through the
application of a time-density model fitted to daily reconstructed marine abundance estimates as well as
catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) data collected by gillnet and purse test fishing vessels in Statistical Areas 12
and 20 (Michielsens and Cave 2019, Chapter B19). As the season progressed, the Early Thompson run

169

In-season Assessments: Run size assessment

size was derived by combining: 1) daily reconstructed marine abundance estimates on days for which
abundances had been estimated at the Mission hydroacoustic site, 2) six-day projections of marine
abundances based on marine CPUE data in combination with marine catchability estimates, and 3)
predictions of the abundance seaward of marine test fisheries based on the time-density model. The
resulting run size estimate for Early Thompson, including the associated uncertainty, was used as an
uncertain input into the model to predict the run size of Late Shuswap/Portage. For this model, we
assumed a lognormal distribution for the Early Thompson run size:

(16)  𝑁𝑅,𝐸𝑇ℎ𝑜 ~ Lognormal(ln(𝑚), 1/𝑙𝑛(1 + 𝐶𝑉2))

With m and CV being the median and coefficient of variation of the in-season run size distribution for
Early Thompson.

The proportion of Early Thompson post-smolts (pETho) among out-migrating smolts of both Early
Thompson and Late Shuswap/Portage was estimated assuming the observed Early Thompson smolt
𝑜𝑏𝑠  from various juvenile sample collection programs in different areas (A) followed a

binomial distribution:

(17)  𝑝𝐸𝑇ℎ𝑜,𝐴

𝑜𝑏𝑠

 ~ Binomial(𝑝𝐸𝑇ℎ𝑜, 𝑛𝐴)

where nA was the total sample size of Early Thompson and Late Shuswap/Portage post-smolts in area A.
Bayesian application of this model required a prior probability distribution for the Early Thompson post-
smolt proportion, which was assumed to be an uninformative, uniform distribution between 0 and 1:

(18)  𝑝𝐸𝑇ℎ𝑜 ~ Uniform(0,1).

The model described above was developed and run in WinBUGS 1.4 (Spiegelhalter et al. 2003). Model
results underwent diagnostics to remove the impact of initial MCMC samples, to eliminate the negative
impact of autocorrelation within the MCMC chains, and to ensure convergence (Best et al. 1995). We
assumed that the reported statistics of the posterior probability distributions represented the true
underlying distributions. Results were reported in terms of the median and the 80% probability interval
(PI).

Results
In 2018, the median pre-season forecast for the return of Late Shuswap/Portage sockeye was 7.0 million
(80% PI: 3.3 – 15.1 million), comprising 99.5% 2-ocean sockeye. At the median forecast, this group was
forecast to contribute 95% of the total return of the Late-run management group. Two years prior, in
2016, the ratios of Late Shuswap/Portage to Early Thompson out-migrating juveniles did not differ
significantly across juvenile programs (p = 0.31), and the average was 4.4 to 1 (80% PI: 4.1 – 4.8). This
ratio was applied to the in-season run size estimate of Early Thompson to generate an estimate of the
Late Shuswap/Portage run. On August 10, the first in-season Late Shuswap/Portage SMURFing estimate
was presented to the Fraser Panel, 3.6 million (80% PI: 2.6 – 5.0 million), based on an Early Thompson
estimate of 0.81 million (80% PI: 0.63 – 1.07 million). Two weeks later (August 24), when the Early
Thompson estimate was 1.26 million (80% PI: 1.23 – 1.32 million), the corresponding SMURFing
estimate for Late Shuswap/Portage was 5.6 million (80% PI: 5.2– 5.9 million).

The resulting uncertainty in the run-size estimate for Late Shuswap/Portage was a function of the
uncertainty in the ratio of Late Shuswap/Portage to Early Thompson in the juvenile sample and the
uncertainty in the in-season run size estimate of Early Thompson. The former estimate (the ratio and its
uncertainty) was a fixed property of the juvenile sample, whereas the latter estimate fluctuated as
dictated by in-season data, trending toward lower uncertainty as more of the Early Thompson run size

170

In-season Assessments: Run size assessment

was accounted for by high-precision hydroacoustic and catch accounting methods. SMURFing estimates
change with every update to the estimated abundance of the Predicted Stock.

The results from SMURFing can be compared against other in-season and post-season estimates. In
2018, the first time-density model estimate of Late Shuswap/Portage was reported to the Panel on
August 21 (6.3 million; 80% PI: 4.3 – 19.0 million). On August 24, a more precise estimate (6.3 million;
80% PI: 3.7 – 9.4 million) was presented. From August 28 through mid-September precision of this
estimate varied little; the median estimate fluctuated between 5.7 and 6.5 million, while the 80% PI was
stable near 3.7 – 7.2 million. The estimated return of Late Shuswap/Portage at the end of the season
was 4.5 million, which was 97.5% of the accounted Late run. The final in-season ratio of Late
Shuswap/Portage to Early Thompson stocks was 3.4, significantly lower than the ratio of 4.4 estimated
from post-smolt samples. In 2014, this ratio was more similar between post-smolt samples and eventual
estimates in the 2014 return year (Latham and Michielsens 2022).

Planned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement
Because SMURFing to assess Late Shuswap/Portage is only done on 2018 cycle years, and historical
juvenile data are limited, evaluations of the performance of this model in comparison to other in-season
run-size models has been restricted to 2014 and 2018 and is somewhat anecdotal. It is therefore
important to better understand the underlying assumptions: the degree to which these assumptions are
violated, factors that minimize or exacerbate those violations, and the impact of those violations on
assessments. Future analyses will include a greater number of potential pairs of Reference Stocks and
Predicted Stocks to better understand these uncertainties and possibly expand the applicability of
SMURFing in Fraser Panel assessment and management.

B21. Gulf Troll-based Run Size

M.J. Hague and C.G.J. Michielsens

Summary
Early in-season indications of Fraser River sockeye abundance are provided by marine test
fishery data. While these abundance estimates are uncertain given both the daily and
interannual variability in catchability, once fish reach the hydroacoustic site in the Fraser River,
these initial estimates are updated with more precise reconstructed estimates calculated from
abundance at Mission plus seaward catches. However, some populations may delay their
upstream migration for days, or even weeks. When they do migrate upstream, the fish are
often redistributed, making it impossible to replace the initial test fishing-based daily marine
abundance estimates with more accurate hydroacoustic-based estimates. Delay in upstream
migration mainly occurs among Harrison and Late-run stocks excluding Birkenhead/Big Silver,
and has the biggest impact on fisheries management on years with large Late Shuswap
abundance (i.e., 2018 cycle line years). On those years, an additional Strait of Georgia troll test
fishery is operated in August and September to provide additional information regarding the
presence and magnitude of delaying fish. More specifically, the CPUE data from the Gulf troll
test fishery is used to predict the abundance of Late-run fish holding in the Strait of Georgia.
The resulting estimate can be combined with estimates of upstream fish passage, catch, and
abundance seaward of the Gulf troll sampling areas to provide updated estimates of Late-run
run size.

Introduction
As part of the Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST) agreements (PST 2020, Chapter 4, paragraph 13(a)), PSC staff
are responsible for providing in-season updates of Fraser River sockeye salmon run size, timing, and
diversion rate. For most of the sockeye stocks, preliminary daily abundance estimates derived from
marine test fishery catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data are later replaced with more precise reconstructed
daily abundance estimates based on hydroacoustic data collected at Mission and seaward catches
(Chapter B18). However, some sockeye stocks delay their upstream migration and hold in the Strait of
Georgia for days, or even weeks (Lapointe et al. 2003). This behavior is most apparent for Harrison, Late-
Shuswap and Weaver-Cultus stock components (Lapointe et al. 2003). Due to both the redistribution of
the run as well as the large amount of time it may take to reach the river, Mission-based abundance
estimates cannot be used for these stocks to update the initial daily abundance estimates from marine
test fisheries. The highly variable and unpredictable nature of the extent of the delay further
complicates their in-season assessment.

To improve in-season assessment information for delaying stocks, a troll test fishery was established in
1987 in the Strait of Georgia, i.e., the Gulf troll test fishery (Chapter B1, Nelitz et al. 2018). While the
initial purpose of this fishery was to confirm the presence or absence of a significant number of delaying
fish in the Gulf, as well as estimate their abundance, over time these estimates were incorporated
formally into the run size assessment procedures for Late-run stocks.

Data
The Gulf Troll test-fishery in the Strait of Georgia is usually initiated in mid-August and runs through
September. The actual end-date of this fishery depends on the timing of the upstream migration of the

173

In-season Assessments: Run size assessment

run. During this time, two vessels survey six defined areas, or quadrants, on a weekly basis (Figure 1).
Each vessel spends approximately 8 hours covering one quadrant a day (Lagasse et al. 2020), thereby
completing the survey of all six quadrants after 3 days. This fishery is typically only in operation on
dominant and sub-dominant cycle line years when Late run abundance is expected to be high, and a
substantial percentage of Late-run stocks are expected to exhibit delay behavior.

Figure 1. Location of the six quadrants (Q-1 to Q-6A) surveyed by the Gulf Troll test fishery. All six
areas are surveyed by two vessels over the course of 3 days and CPUE of the individual quadrants
is weighted by the relative area of each quadrant to derive a combined CPUE estimate.

The Gulf Troll catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) is defined as catch-per-1000 hook minutes, where hook-
minutes are calculated as the total daily fishing time multiplied by the average number of hooks per line
on each vessel (Cave 1997, Chapter B2). To account for density dependent effects on the catchability of
the troll test fishery (once a hook has caught a fish, it is no longer fishing), the total CPUE data of all fish
species combined is corrected to derive the sockeye-specific CPUE using the following equation:

(8)

𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑠 =

𝐶𝑠
𝐶𝑇

𝑒(0.123+1.012∙𝑙𝑛 𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑇+0.0746∙(𝑙𝑛 𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑇)2)

where Cs/CT is the proportion sockeye (s) in the total catch (CT) and CPUET is the unadjusted all-species
catch-per-unit-effort. The latter is based on the catch of all target and non-target species including

174

In-season Assessments: Run size assessment

shakers (under-sized juvenile salmonids). These calculations are done for each of the six individual
quadrants.

Figure 2. Relationship between corrected (Equation 1) and uncorrected sockeye CPUE in the Gulf
troll test fishery. The solid line is the 1:1 relationship. Outliers are rare occurrences where effort
was low, catch of other salmon species was high, and catch of sockeye was low.

Once all 6 quadrants have been surveyed, the sockeye CPUE of a survey period is then estimated by
weighing the sockeye CPUE of the individual quadrants by the proportion each quadrant represents in
the total area surveyed (pq, Table 1):

(9)

6
𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸 = ∑ (𝑝𝑞 ∙ 𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑞)
𝑞=1

.

All quadrants carry similar weight except quadrant four (largest area) and quadrant 6 (smallest area).
Prior to using the CPUE data in the model to predict the abundance of delaying Late run sockeye, the
CPUE data are multiplied with the proportion of Late run stocks within the DNA samples taken from Gulf
Troll catches.

Migration into the Strait of Georgia is estimated using a forward reconstruction of daily abundance
estimates based on seaward test fisheries (Chapter B18). In the post-season, these daily marine
abundances are rescaled so that the total marine estimate is equivalent to the final in-season run size
estimate based on Mission abundance plus seaward catch. In the forward reconstruction, a fixed 4-day
migration time is assumed between the Area 20 reference location and the entrance to the Strait of

175

In-season Assessments: Run size assessment

Georgia. Once fish resume their spawning migration, it is assumed they need an additional 4-days to
migrate from the Strait of Georgia to the Mission hydroacoustic site.

The historical abundance estimates of Late-run salmon resident in the Strait of Georgia on a given day
(Nd,SoG) are calculated by removing catches (C) and estimates of daily migration into the Fraser River
(Nd,Mission) from the cumulative abundance of fish entering the Strait of Georgia:

(10)  𝑁𝑑,𝐴𝑖 = (∑
𝑑=1

𝑁𝑑 − ∑

𝐶𝑑,𝐴

𝑛
) − (∑
𝑑=1

𝑁𝑑,𝑀𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 + ∑

𝐴𝑗
𝐴=𝐴𝑖

𝐶𝑑,𝐴

)

where Ai indicates the Strait of Georgia area, A1 to Ai-1 indicate all the areas seaward of the Strait of
Georgia and Ai to Aj include all the areas seaward of Mission until and including the Strait of Georgia.
Equation 3 assumes the dates associated with all catch and abundance estimates are adjusted to reflect
reference location dates based on the amount of time (rounded to the day) it takes for sockeye to
migrate from the area to the reference location (Chapter B18).

Methods
To estimate the total abundance in the Strait of Georgia, a log-linear regression model is used that
relates historical estimates of CPUE to total abundances in the Gulf on a given day (Nd):

(11)

𝑙𝑛(𝑁𝑑) = 𝑎 + 𝑏 ∙ 𝑙𝑛(𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑑)

Structural uncertainty and observation error are incorporated into the model through the use of a
Bayesian framework. While uncertainty in catchability is accounted for, the model assumes that
catchability remains stationary.  However, experts (both biologist and fishermen alike) suspect that
catchability declines as the season progresses as fish (a) redistribute closer to the river mouth and
become inaccessible to fishing gear, and (b) rates of gear attraction decline as salmon stop feeding
closer to their spawning time. For these reasons, and also supported by statistical evidence, the
historical dataset is divided into two time periods: August and September, and separate models are used
in each month to estimate total Late run abundances. Analyses also suggest a statistical difference in
model fit between dominant/sub-dominant years and off cycle years. Therefore, various model
combinations using different data subsets were explored, including different cycle-line combinations
and separation or pooling of August and September timeseries. Due to data limitations, care should be
taken when running the model for dominant years only using only September or August data.

Results
The model produces estimate of the number of delaying Late run sockeye in the Gulf of Georgia, both in
terms of the median and the 80% probability interval (Figure 3). The resulting estimates can be
combined with estimates of observed catch, escapement estimates and seaward projections to derive
total run size estimates (Table 2). The seaward projections are obtained from a combination of
reconstructed abundance estimates based on more seaward marine test fishing data (Chapter B18) and
predictions of the tail of the run seaward of the marine test fishery using the time-density model
(Chapter B19).

of the different alternative models in terms of their ability to predict the abundance in the Strait of
Georgia will be evaluated as well as the methods to combine Gulf troll estimates with estimates of catch
and escapement and seaward projections to predict total run size estimates.

B22. Management Adjustments

M.R. Forrest and M.J. Hague

Summary
Management Adjustments (MAs) are the additional fish allocated to escape fisheries for the
purpose of increasing the likelihood of achieving the spawning escapement target (SET). The
selection of an appropriate MA is within the purview of the Fraser River Panel who take into
account en-route losses due to adverse migration condition but also other factors that cause
differences between predicted and observed spawning ground estimates (DBEs, Differences
Between Estimates). Historical DBE estimates are based on differences between the actual
number of spawners on the spawning grounds (spawning escapement SE) and the predicted
spawning ground estimates based on the number of salmon migrating past the hydroacoustic
site at Mission minus the total catch above Mission (potential spawning escapement PSE,
DBE=SE-PSE).  Sources for DBEs include en-route mortality as well as errors (bias and
imprecision) introduced through the estimates of Mission escapement, spawning ground
escapement, First Nations and recreational catches above Mission, and stock composition. Pre-
season and in-season, DBE predictions can be obtained through a variety of different methods:
based on historical discrepancies or based on observed or forecasted environmental conditions
or migration timing. The Fraser River Panel uses these DBE predictions and other tools and
information to agree upon MAs for pre-season planning and in-season management.

Introduction
In-season, PSC staff incorporate Fraser River Panel agreed upon MAs into TAC calculations in accordance
with the Pacific Salmon Treaty Chapter IV, section 13b. The Panel relies on a variety of different pieces
of information to derive the MA: historical estimates of difference between post-season observations
and in-season projections of spawner numbers, i.e., the difference between estimates (DBEs), in-season
environmental observations, and in-season model predictions of the DBE. The latter are based on
statistical models using observed and in-season forecasts of river conditions and in-river migration
timing. The models consider the historical differences between post-season spawning ground estimates
(spawning escapement SE) and in-season projections of spawning escapement, i.e., Mission escapement
minus catch above Mission (potential spawning escapement PSE, DBE= SE-PSE). For Early Stuart, Early
Summer-run and Summer-run stocks, the models relate historical DBE estimates to river conditions
measured near Hope, B.C. in the Fraser River (Chapter B24). When discharge levels or temperatures are
above average, DBEs also tend to be high. In addition, for Early Stuart and Early Summer runs, in-season
estimates are consistently higher than spawning ground estimates even when migration conditions are
within normal ranges, and this tendency is also captured by the models. For Late-run sockeye, historical
DBEs are related to the date when half the run has migrated past Mission (i.e., Mission 50% date), which
captures the impact of the early migration behaviour observed since the mid-1990s on the migration
success of these stocks (Lapointe et al. 2003, Chapter B25).

Data
The historical escapement differences, 50% migration dates at Hells Gate and Mission and the
associated 19-day mean and 31-day mean temperature and discharge estimates are the primary
biological data used in the statistical models. The historical DBE estimates and the 50% migration dates

179

In-season Assessments: Environmental information

are summarised primarily by management group, except for some stocks like Pitt, Chilliwack,
Harrison/Widgeon and Birkenhead/Big Silver, whose location closer to the mouth of the Fraser River
decreases expected en-route losses associated with adverse migration conditions. The resulting DBE
data therefore relates to the following groups: Early Stuart, Early Summer run without the Pitt and
Chilliwack River components, Pitt River, Chilliwack River, Summer run without the Harrison/Widgeon
component, Harrison/Widgeon, Late run group without the Birkenhead/Big Silver component and
Birkenhead/Big Silver. Data for other groupings are also maintained, however, currently not used. The
historical data ranges from 1977 to present. Some years are excluded for a management group or
component to avoid potential biases in escapement estimates: if the year is not representative, if the
data collection is not comparable to current practice or if the circumstances resulting in the estimates
are unlikely to happen again. A list of the excluded years for each of management group or component
can be found on the PSC SharePoint site for the Fraser River Panel among the data set files and is
updated regularly.

The 50% Hells Gate date for a management group is determined from its Area 20 date (Chapter B18).
The travel time from Area 20 to Mission is assumed to be 6 days for the Early Stuart, Early Summer and
Summer run sockeye. The subsequent travel time from Mission to Hells Gate is assumed to be 5 days for
the Early Stuart and Summer run sockeye and only 4 days for the Early Summer run sockeye. The Late
run travel time from Area 20 to Hells Gate depends on their delay before up-stream migration and
varies substantially across years.

The Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) Environmental Watch Program provides both historical as well as in-
season observed and forecasted Fraser River temperatures and flows (Chapter B23). In-season the
observations and forecasts of daily temperature and discharge are provided twice weekly, are presented
in graphs to Fraser River Panel (Figure 1), and are used within mathematical models to predict the
discrepancy between the SE and PSE, i.e., to predict the DBE. The forecasts allow the Fraser River Panel
to make informed in-season fisheries decisions 3-4 days after the 50% date in Area 20 but prior to all 19
days of temperature and discharge data are available. This facilitates a more informed decision-making
process and allows the Fraser Panel to proactively update in-season management adjustments to
improve the probability of achieving spawning escapement goals.

In addition to the data used within the models predicting the DBE, the Fraser River Panel also
incorporates additional information in their decision-making process. To that aim, the DFO
Environmental Watch group also provides temperature data from the Fraser River mainstem and
tributaries and how they compare to historical estimates (Table 1). Additional observations such as
migration challenges, observed mortalities, pooling fish and observations on the spawning grounds are
collected by DFO (DFO Stock Assessment, DFO Resource Management and other research groups) and
communicated to the Fraser Panel. This includes the migration challenges encountered following the Big
Bar rockslide and subsequent remediation work.

Methods
In-season DBE predictions provided by PSC Secretariat staff are based on temperature and discharge
models and run-timing models. For Early Stuart, Early Summer and Summer run, there exist significant
relationships between temperature, discharge and historical DBEs (Chapter B24). For Late-run sockeye
the mathematical model is a regression model that relates extended freshwater residence to DBE
estimates (Chapter B25).

Some components of a management group are excluded from the models and alternative methods to
predict the DBEs for those components are used: Pitt River and Chilliwack for the Early Summer run
group, Harrison/Widgeon for the Summer run group, and Birkenhead/Big Silver for the Late run group.

Among Early Summer run stocks, Pitt River sockeye do not pass Mission and their passage is therefore
not well estimated. In addition, their upstream migration distance within the Fraser River is short and
thus they have minimal exposure to adverse river conditions. Given the data issues, a fixed DBE is used
for Pitt River based on the median of all years with suitable data. The upstream migration distance to
Chilliwack is similarly short, resulting in minimal exposure to adverse river conditions. The timing of this
stock is substantially earlier than the timing of other Early Summer run stocks and this would impact the
50% migration date when combined with other Early Summer run stocks. In addition, the abundance of
Chilliwack sockeye has not been estimated well prior to the use of DNA to identify stocks. Given the low
abundance of Chilliwack on certain years, the DBE for Chilliwack is based on the median of all suitable
years of data that have more than 30 sockeye identified as Chilliwack fish within the river. And on
dominant and subdominant years, when Chilliwack abundances are higher and the quality of the DBE
estimates is therefore greater, only the dominant and subdominant years of data are used to derive the
median.

For Summer run sockeye, Harrison/Widgeon sockeye data are excluded from environmental DBE models
because of their shorter migration distance within the Fraser River and because the relationship
between Harrison/Widgeon DBEs and environmental conditions is poor. The DBE for Harrison/Widgeon

182

In-season Assessments: Environmental information

sockeye can also be significant while the DBEs for other Summer run sockeye is much smaller. The DBE
for Harrison/Widgeon sockeye is based on the median of all suitable years since the start of the DNA
collection.

For Late-run sockeye, Birkenhead/Big Silver sockeye are excluded from the DBE models because, unlike
other late run stocks, these sockeye don’t delay their upstream migration in Georgia Strait. The DBE for
Birkenhead/BigSilver sockeye is based on the median across all suitable years.

The Fraser River Panel however manages Fraser River sockeye by management group. To accommodate
the different DBEs for each component of a management group, a weighted proportion DBE (pDBE)
approach is used. The MA models predict the pDBE for each management group excluding the
components that rely on historical medians. Subsequently, a weighted average pDBE is calculated to
combine the estimates of the different components. This is done by weighting the pDBE of each
component by the associated relative abundance. Because the management group pDBEs depend on
the relative abundance of the components, in-season DBEs can change with changes in run-size,
regardless of changes in DBE predictions. When the abundances of the components are small relative to
the total management group, weighting the pDBE by the components has almost no impact on the
aggregate pDBE. The weighted approach is most beneficial for Late run stocks with high proportions of
Birkenhead/Big Silver (PSC 2019). Following the results of additional retrospective analyses, the Panel
has foregone the weighted approach when the abundance of the components is small relative to the
total management group.

For in-season Fraser River Panel meetings, the Panel is provided with graphs of Fraser River temperature
at Qualark, B.C. and Fraser River discharge at Hope, B.C. (Figure 1), a table of Fraser River mainstem and
tributary temperatures (Table 1) and the predictions of the DBE models (Chapters B24 and B25) as well
as in river observations such as carcass counts, fish holding behavior and fish condition and reports from
the spawning grounds or from other areas with potential migration challenges such as Big Bar.

The Panel may choose to adopt (if either party accepts) or not adopt (if both parties reject) the MA
estimate corresponding to the pDBE prediction for a management group or may choose a different
value as they see fit (by bilateral agreement).

Planned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement
There is a cost to underestimating or overestimating in-river loss. When the DBE is underestimated
managers do not meet spawning objectives. If the DBE is overestimated harvest opportunities are lost.
The DFO Environmental group and PSC staff continue to work at improving the models and tools used to
estimate en-route loss.

Currently models and other tools are focused on the environmental impact on in-river migration to the
spawning grounds. There is currently no way to forecast bias and imprecision in Mission escapement
estimates, in-river catch estimates, spawning escapement estimates and stock composition.

In addition to the statistical MA models, the Fraser River Panel uses other tools to supplement their
decision-making process. They can also use “the Supplemental Approach” which relies on temperature
and discharge thresholds identified by the historical data. This method is currently being evaluated
through retrospective analyses. The MA models and the additional MA tools aid the Panel in their
directive to achieve spawning escapement targets and maximize harvest opportunities for Fraser
sockeye.

B23. EWatch Temperature and Discharge Forecasts

M.R. Forrest, M.J. Hague and D. Patterson

Summary
The DFO Environmental Watch (EWatch) Program provides PSC managers with scientific advice
and environmental data to assess the impact of different environmental factors on the
migration success of Pacific salmon in fresh water (https://www.pac.dfo-
mpo.gc.ca/science/habitat/frw-rfo/index-eng.html#info). In-season EWatch generates Fraser
River forecasts of water temperature at Qualark, B.C. and discharge at Hope, B.C. and provides
this information to the Fraser River Panel in bi-weekly reports from July to September. They
also provide real time temperature data from key EWatch temperature monitoring stations
within the Fraser River watershed and real time Fraser River discharge data from a Water
Survey of Canada (https://wateroffice.ec.gc.ca) site in the lower river. The temperature and
discharge forecasts are used along with observed daily temperature and discharge in
environmental models (Chapter B24) to provide the Fraser River Panel with early indications of
adverse environmental conditions and potential en-route losses, that may impact their
Management Adjustment (MA) decisions (Chapter B22).

Introduction
For the management of Fraser River sockeye salmon, the Fraser River Panel relies on Management
Adjustments (MAs), which are the additional fish allowed to escape fisheries to increase the likelihood
of achieving the spawning escapement target (SET) (Chapter B22). To select appropriate values for the
MAs, the Panel relies on a wide range of different pieces of information that allow to evaluate in-river
migration conditions and potential en-route losses. Among the information are the results of the models
that relate temperature and discharge within the Fraser River to differences between predicted and
observed spawning ground estimates, i.e., to Differences Between Estimates (DBEs) (Chapter B24).
These models use 19-day average Fraser River temperature at Qualark, B.C. and discharge at Hope, B.C.,
associated with the 50% migration date of the management group, as model inputs. Of the 19 days, 15
days of data proceed the Hells Gate migration date. The DFO Environmental Watch group is responsible
for providing both observed and forecasted Fraser River temperature and flows twice weekly
throughout the migration season (Patterson et al. 2008). The 10-day forecasts (Morrison 2005, Morrison
et al. 2005, Hague et al. 2014) provide managers with an early indication of the expected DBE and allow
the Fraser River Panel to make informed fisheries decisions 3-4 days after the 50% date in Area 20. This
facilitates a more informed decision-making process and allows the Fraser Panel to proactively adjust
management actions to improve the probability of achieving spawning escapement goals.

Water temperature and discharge are forecasted by different methods. In the past, a complex
hydrological model (Morrison 2005) that required intensive meteorological inputs was used to make the
10-day forecasts of Fraser River temperature at Qualark. Currently the Hope Statistical Model (HSM)
(Hague et al. 2014) and a generalized additive mixed effects model (GAMM) (Gardner 2016) are used to
forecast Fraser River temperature at Qualark, B.C. The evaluations of the HSM (Hague et al. 2014) and
the GAMM (Gardner 2016) models confirmed the benefit of using these less data intensive models to
inform fisheries decisions. These models using air temperature and discharge covariates explained a
significant proportion of the variability in daily summer water temperatures in the Fraser River. To
produce the 10-day forecast of Fraser River discharge at Hope, the first 3 days are forecasted using a

185

In-season Assessments: Environmental information

routing model based on upstream flows and the next 7 days are forecasted using an historic decay
model that tracks the shape of historic hydrograph.

Data
The EWatch program has an environmental monitoring program which consists of a comprehensive
network of temperature logger stations along key salmon migration routes throughout the Fraser
Watershed (https://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/habitat/frw-rfo/index-eng.html#info) (Figure 1).
The EWatch program provides the PSC with observed Fraser River water temperature data from this
network of real-time data loggers and from others that are operated by Water Survey of Canada. The
EWatch group also provides the PSC with observed discharge data from Water Survey of Canada
(https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/water-
overview/quantity/monitoring/survey.html).

Figure 1. Locations of key EWatch and WSC temperature monitoring stations and major Fraser
River sockeye salmon spawning grounds (https://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/habitat/frw-
rfo/index-eng.html)

Because Hells Gate forms a well-known impediment to salmon migration (Roos 1991, Macdonald et al.
2000) and because there exist long time-series of historical environmental conditions associated with
the monitoring stations located at Hope and Qualark (Patterson et al. 2007, Macdonald et al. 2010),
these two sites are used as the main geographic reference points to describe Fraser River environmental
conditions.

The following list provides a detailed overview of the various data sets used to derive the observed and
forecasted water temperature and discharge time series:

•  Historical daily mean Fraser River water temperatures recorded near Qualark, B.C.: data prior to

2007 (Patterson et al. 2007), data from 2007 to current (DFO, EWatch Program).

186

In-season Assessments: Environmental information

•  Observed daily Fraser River upstream temperatures measured by Water Survey of Canada
(https://wateroffice.ec.gc.ca/login_e.html). Verified and collated by the EWatch program.

•  Observed and Historical daily discharge recorded near Hope, B.C.: Wateroffice, Government of

Canada - Real-Time Hydrometric Data (https://wateroffice.ec.gc.ca/login_e.html).
Due to the inverse relationship between discharge and thermal capacity (Web et al. 2003),
discharge explains a significant proportion of the variability in water temperature (Neumann et
al. 2003, van Vliet et al. 2011). Daily mean river discharge near Hope, B.C. was identified as
providing the best fit to Qualark water temperatures (Hague et al. 2014).

•  Air temperature – Environment and Climate Change Canada (https://weather.gc.ca/).

Water temperature has a high correlation with air temperature (Cluis 1972, Kothandaram and
Evans 1972, Stefan and Preud’homme 1993) because they are influenced by the same heat
transfer processes (Mohseni and Steffan 1999). Air temperatures from Kamloops, B.C. were
shown to provide the best fit to Qualark water temperatures relative to that from other
locations further upstream or downstream in the watershed (Hague et. al 2014).

•  Air temperature forecast - Forecasts of air temperature come from both Environment and

Climate Change Canada (https://weather.gc.ca/) and Weather Network
(https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca).

•  Hope discharge forecast - Since 2020, forecasted flows have been supplemented by the BC River
forecast center, using the CLEVER model (http://bcrfc.env.gov.bc.ca/freshet/map_clever.html).

Methods
The EWatch group uses a combination of the Hope Statistical Model (HSM, Hague et al. 2014) and a
generalized additive mixed effects model (GAMM) (Gardner 2016) to produce 10-day forecasts of Fraser
River temperature at Qualark.

The statistical model to produce 10-day daily forecasts of river temperature (Hague et al. 2014) is a
stochastic model in which daily water temperature (T) is predicted using a combination of seasonal and
non-seasonal components, similar to Caissie et al. (2001):

(1)

𝑇 = 𝑆 + 𝑅 + 𝑟

whereby S is the seasonal (harmonic) variability in water temperature, R is the non-seasonal variability
driven by exogenous environmental variables and r is the non-seasonal variability driven by serial
autocorrelation. A range of different statistical models following equation 1 are used to forecast the
daily temperature. While S and r are common to all these models, the non-seasonal variation in water
temperature R is distinct for each model by using seasonal residuals of air temperature, discharge, or air
temperature and discharge. A harmonic method (Hague et al. 2014, Cluis 1972, Caissie et al. 2001) to
model seasonal trends for the water temperature, air temperature and discharge is applied. The
advantage of using statistical models is the relative simplicity and minimal data requirements (Benyahya
et al. 2007, Hague et al. 2014). They require less physical input data and typically use readily available
measurements of air temperature, river flow, and water temperature along with historical seasonal
trends to generate short-term river temperature forecasts (Gardner 2016).

The GAMM model is the second model used for short-term forecasting of river temperature and
provides broader spatial coverage with more flexible and cost-effective implementation of river
temperature forecasting (Gardner 2016). This approach models in-season temperatures by combining a
linear regression model for daily water temperature with a sinusoidal smoothing spline of seasonal
trends (Gardner 2016):

In equation 2, Ti,j is the predicted river temperature on day i in year j, Ai-1, Qi-1, Ti-1 are respectively the air
temperature, the discharge and the water temperature of the previous day, Ai-1xL is the interaction of
air temperature and location and f represents a cubic regression spline smoothing function of Julian day,
which allows the model to fit the seasonal trend. The residual error (ε), and year-specific variation of
intercept (µj) are normally distributed with a mean of zero. In this model, discharge, air temperature,
water temperature, and location are all fixed effects. Discharge (Q, m3/s) is used as a predictor variable
to account for the inverse relationship between discharge and river temperature (Webb et al. 2003). Air
temperature (A, ℃) is included due to the high correlation between air and water temperature
(Kothandaraman 1972, Stefan and Preud’homme 1993) from heat exchange processes (Mohseeni and
Stefan 1999). Current water temperature (T, ℃) is a predictor of water temperature in the near future
(Caissie et al. 1998). Location (L) is included as a fixed effect due to the differences in mean temperature
at different locations, as well as the location-specific effects of air and discharge on river temperature.

The model choice (HSM versus GAMM) and forecast inputs are a function of past model performance
and the available data. Both the HSM and the GAMM model are evaluated annually by the EWatch
group using three main performance metrics (root mean square error, mean raw error and mean
absolute error) which compare forecasted and observed water temperature values. Errors in forecasted
discharge and temperature are also evaluated. In addition, the model’s performance is evaluated using
type I (false-positive) and type II (false-negative) error rates which are associated with critical
temperature thresholds related to salmon migration performance and mortality (18-21°C).  In future,
type I and type II error rates which are associated with critical discharge thresholds will be evaluated as
well.

Discharge is forecasted by two different models. For the first 3-days of the forecast, a routing model
based on upstream flows is used (pers. comm. D. Patterson). For the last 7-days of the forecast a historic
decay model is used (pers. comm. D. Patterson). This model uses the historic slope for a given day of the
year applied to the previous days forecast. Reports describing the methods and comparative analyses to
methods used by the B.C. River Forecast Centre are still in progress.

Planned Changes and Potential Ireas for improvement
As indicated above, the temperature and discharge forecasts are used in-season along with observed
temperature and discharge in statistical models to provide managers with an early indication of the
expected discrepancy between the predicted and observed spawning ground estimates, i.e. the
difference between estimates (DBEs). These DBE models incorporate uncertainty through Bayesian
estimates. The Fraser Panel is provided with a confidence level on the likelihood of obtaining different
values of a parameter when particular data have been observed (Ellison 1996). However, the Fraser
Panel would also like to see the uncertainty in the temperature and discharge forecasts being
incorporated. This is something to consider in the future.

B24. DBE Temperature and Discharge Model

M.R. Forrest and M.J. Hague

Summary
Since 2002, the Pacific Salmon Commission has used environmental conditions in the lower
Fraser River to predict differences between potential spawning escapement based on Mission
estimates minus upstream catch and escapement on the spawning grounds (Macdonald et al.
2010). Reliably predicting the discrepancy between estimates (DBEs) increases the probability
of achieving spawning escapement targets. Temperature and discharge models are used by the
PSC to provide the Panel with likely spawning escapement outcomes and the Panel uses this
information to determine how many extra fish are needed to meet spawning objectives, i.e. the
size of the Management Adjustment (MA, Chapter B22). In these models, mean Fraser River
temperature at Qualark, B.C. and mean Fraser River discharge at Hope, B.C. (Morrison 2005,
Morrison et al. 2005, Hague et al. 2014) are related to historical timeseries of escapement
discrepancies to generate either pre-season or in-season DBE predictions for Fraser River
sockeye salmon (O. nerka) management (or run timing) groups.

Introduction
Under the Pacific Salmon Treaty, the Fraser River Panel has the discretion to add additional fish to the
spawning escapement target (SET) set by Canada for Fraser River sockeye salmon (O. nerka) to ensure
spawning requirements are met (PST, Article IV, Chapter 4, Paragraph 3b). These additional fish are
called the Management Adjustment (MA) and are meant to increase the likelihood of achieving the SET
(Chapter B22). Post-season, MAs are defined by the differences between estimates (DBEs), i.e., the
difference between the predicted spawning ground estimates (Potential Spawning Escapement, PSE, i.e.
the number of salmon migrating past the hydroacoustic site at Mission minus the total catch above
Mission), and the actual postseason estimates of the total number of spawners at the spawning grounds
(Spawning Escapement, PE), with DBE=SE-PSE. Pre-season and in-season, DBE predictions can be derived
through a variety of different methods: based on historical discrepancies, based on observed or
forecasted environmental conditions or based on migration timing. This Chapter focuses on the
temperature and discharge models developed jointly between the PSC and DFO to predict the DBE for
Early Stuart, Early Summer-run and Summer-run sockeye (Macdonald et al. 2010). Each run timing group
experiences distinct river conditions, with a greater likelihood of extreme discharge during the early runs
and extreme temperature during the summer runs. Environmental extremes are known to create
migratory challenges and contribute to increased levels of mortality during the return spawning
migration. Historically, when discharge levels or temperatures within the Fraser River are above
average, DBEs tend to be high. In addition, for Early Stuart and Early Summer runs, in-season Potential
Spawning Escapement estimates are consistently higher than spawning ground estimates even when
migration conditions are within normal ranges, and this tendency is also captured by the DBE models.

Data
The historical escapement differences (DBEs), Hells Gate 50% dates and associated 19-day mean and 31-
day mean temperature and discharge data are the primary data used in the environmentally-based DBE
models (Chapter B22). The DBEs are calculated as the difference between the spawning escapement
(spawning ground estimate) and the potential spawning escapement (Mission passage minus catch

191

In-season Assessments: Environmental information

upstream of Mission). Each management group has its own DBE dataset because each group
experiences different environmental conditions depending on when they migrate up the Fraser River.

The Hells Gate 50% date is the date on which 50% of the management group will pass Hells Gate in the
Fraser River. The Hells Gate date is calculated based on marine migration dates indexed to statistical
Area 20 in Juan de Fuca Strait (Chapter B18). The travel time from Area 20 to Mission (the location of
the PSC hydroacoustic monitoring program) is assumed to be 6-days for the Early Stuart, Early Summer
and Summer run sockeye. The travel time from Mission to Hells Gate is assumed to be 5-days for the
Early Stuart and Summer run sockeye and 4-days for the Early Summer run sockeye. In-season, the Area
20 dates for the different management groups derived through the run size assessment models are
converted into Hells Gate Migration dates. This date in return is essential to derive the mean
temperature and discharge information for the different management groups as the 19-day mean water
temperature and discharge estimates used in-season rely on data 15 days before and 3 days after the
Hells Gate date. Post-season, 31 day means are used to summarise the environmental conditions in the
Fraser River, based on 15 days of observations before and 15 days after the Hells Gate date.

The DFO Environmental Watch Program provides updates of observed and forecasted Fraser River water
temperature at Qualark, B.C. and discharge at Hope, B.C. twice weekly throughout the migration season
(Chapter B23). Daily observed discharge values are accessed from the Environment Canada Water Office
online database (https://wateroffice.ec.gc.ca/login_e.html) and daily observed Fraser River water
temperature at Qualark is provided by the DFO Environmental Watch group (Patterson et al. 2007) who
also provides the 10 day forecasts of temperature and discharge. The temperature forecast is predicted
by a statistical model that uses water temperature, air temperature, river discharge and seasonal trends
(Hague et al. 2014) while the discharge forecast is derived by a routing model based on upstream flows
and a historic decay model (pers. comm. D. Patterson).

Methods
The temperature and discharge models use environmental conditions in the Fraser River as predictive
variables to predict the DBE. There are significant relationships between lower river environmental
conditions and historical DBEs for Early Stuart, Early Summer-run and Summer-run management groups
(Macdonald et al. 2010, Cummings et al. 2011, Figure 1).

The resulting DBE temperature and discharge model is expressed as:

𝑙𝑛 (

𝑃𝑆𝐸
𝑆𝐸

) = 𝑎 + 𝑏1 ∙ 𝜇𝑇 + 𝑏2 ∙ 𝜇𝑇

2
2 + 𝑏3 ∙ 𝜇𝑄 + 𝑏4 ∙ 𝜇𝑄

With µ representing the 19-day (in-season) or 31-day (post-season) mean of the Fraser River
temperature (T) or discharge (D) around the Hells Gate migration date. The dependent variable is
expressed as the ratio of the Potential Spawning Escapement (PSE) over the Spawning Escapement (SE).
The log transformation of the dependent variable is required to meet the assumptions of
homoscedasticity (Zar 1996) and to constrain predictions in the range 0 or higher. The predictive
variables are the 19-day or 31-day mean Fraser River temperature (T) and discharge (Q). The quadratic
term for both discharge and temperature is included (T+T2, Q+Q2) in the regression equation.

In-season the 19-day means are based on 9 or more days of observed data and 10 or less days of
forecasted data, given predictions are only made 10 days out because of constraints in forecasting daily
environmental data (Hague and Patterson 2014). The 19-day model provides managers an early in-
season indication of the expected DBE in order to be more proactive in their management process as it
allows a %DBE prediction to be made between 3 to 4 days after the Area 20 50% date and 1 to 2 days
prior to the Mission 50% date. Post-season, once 31 days of observed T & Q data are available for a
management group, the MA models are fit to a 31-day mean T and Q centered around the 50% date at
Hells Gate. The 31-day model captures 90% or more of a run’s exposure to environmental conditions at
Hells Gate and provides a better fit to the historical DBE data than environmental data averaged over a
shorter time-period (Hague et al. 2007).

The model is run in WinBUGS (Spiegelhalter et al. 2003) with an R (R Core Team 2013) interface. This
program allows the application of Bayesian methods to calculate the probability of the value of a
parameter given the observed data (Wade 2000) and to provide an explicit expression of the amount of

193

In-season Assessments: Environmental information

uncertainty in these parameter estimates (Ellison 1996). As a result, it is also possible to quantify the
uncertainty of the forecasted DBE and provide a probability interval (Ellison 1996) in addition to the
point estimate for the forecasted DBE.

Each management group has its own historical dataset and MA models are run separately for each
group. This is because each management group experiences different conditions depending on when
they migrate up the Fraser River. Early Stuart sockeye salmon often experience higher discharges due to
freshet that might continue into early July. Early Summer-run sockeye salmon can experience both high
discharges and high temperatures, as they start their migration while discharge might still be high due to
late freshet, and they may migrate through the peak of high summer water temperatures in the Fraser
River. Summer-run sockeye often experience high temperatures as they also migrate during the peak of
summer; however, depending on their timing they might migrate when days are getting shorter and
night cooling begins.

The current temperature and discharge models predict a DBE for each management group but do not
incorporate stock specific information despite known differences in tolerances to adverse
environmental conditions (Eliason et al. 2011). Stock-specific differences are addressed by reducing the
number of years in the historical dataset used for predicting DBEs. For example, in Dominant or
Subdominant Early South Thompson years, the Early Summer-run dataset might be reduced to only
Dominant or Dominant and Subdominant years. Early South Thompson sockeye generally dominate the
Early Summer run management group in Dominant and Subdominant years and it is believed that their
response to environmental conditions would be better reflected by years in which they make up larger
proportions of the Early Summer run. The datasets can also be reduced to odd years in pink salmon
years and cycle line years. However, this generally reduces the data points and influences the fit of the
model. Another method used to address stock-specific differences is the weighted pDBE approach
described in Chapter B22.

Results
The temperature and discharge models produce prediction of the DBEs, including the 80% probability
interval (PI), for Early Stuart, Early Summer and Summer run stocks for different Area 20 dates indicating
the timing of the run (Table 1). In-season, the Area 20 date or marine migration date will be obtained
from the run size assessment models (Chapter B19). Depending on the Area 20 migration date, the Hells
Gate 50% date will differ and this in turn will impact the 19-days of temperature and discharge data
used within the DBE model. For example, on August 21, the mean temperature and discharge when
assuming the Area 20 timing is August 7, will be based on 19 days of observed data, 15 days observed
prior to the Hells Gate date of August 17 and 3 days after. Because all of the 19 days of temperature and
discharge data for this example are based on observations, no forecasts are needed to calculate the 19-
day means. However, if the Hells Gate migration date is August 18, the 19-day mean used as input in the
DBE model will be based on 18 days of observed data and one forecasted day (August 21). Thanks to the
10-day forecasts of temperature and discharge, DBE predictions can be made 3 to 4 days after the 50%
migration date in Area 20. This allows the Fraser Panel to proactively adjust management actions to
improve the probability of achieving spawning escapement goals and facilitates a more informed
decision-making process.

Table 1. In-season table produced on 21 August 2018 containing the model predictions of
expected percent Differences Between Estimates (%DBEs) and the implied proportional
Management Adjustment (pMA). Depending on the assumed migration timing (Area 20 Date) of
the management group, the 19 day mean temperature and discharge values will differ, resulting
in different DBE predictions.

Model evaluation
DBE models and the derived Management Adjustment are used by managers to achieve spawning
escapement targets while maximizing harvest. Underestimates of the DBE can lead to conservation
concerns if excess catch causes too few fish to reach spawning grounds, whereas overestimates of DBE
can result in foregone catch (Cummings et al. 2011). Various studies have evaluated the performance of
the various DBE models (Cummings et al. 2011, Dionne et al. 2018) used to predict in-river loss.
Cummings et al. (2011) found that although the best DBE models varied depending on the management
group and performance measures, there was strong evidence that DBE forecasts and derived MA
estimates based on some combination of environmental or biological data outperformed the approach
of applying no MA at all.

A study by Hague et al. (2008) examined whether data from lower Fraser River temperature and
discharge stations are appropriate environmental indices for the basin as a whole. Adult salmon
encounter a range of temperatures and discharges along their up-river migration route and these values
may not be consistently well-correlated to lower river conditions, particularly for populations with natal
spawning grounds >500km from the ocean or for populations entering the river after mid-August.
Results suggested that, in general, lower Fraser River environmental conditions were well correlated to
conditions upriver; however, correlation strength decreased as a function of increasing distance and/or
slower migration rates.

Planned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement
Given the cost to underestimating or overestimating DBEs, DFOs EWatch group and PSC staff
continuously work to improve the models and tools used to estimate en-route loss (Patterson et al.
2019, Dionne et al. 2018).

Currently models and other tools are focused on the environmental impact on successful in-river
migration to the spawning grounds. There is currently no way to forecast bias and imprecision in Mission
escapement estimates, in-river catch estimates, spawning escapement estimates and stock composition.

B25. DBE Run Timing Model and Upstream Migration
Timing Model

M.R. Forrest and M.J. Hague

Summary
Late run sockeye stocks excluding Birkenhead/Big Silver traditionally delay their migration to
the Fraser River in the Strait of Georgia. Since 1995, these stocks have however entered the
Fraser River earlier, resulting in extended freshwater residence times, exposure to higher river
temperature and discharge; and increased mortality (Lapointe et al. 2003, Cooke et al. 2004).
The 50% migration date at Mission captures the early migration behaviour and is used as a
predictive tool in the DBE run timing model that relates the upstream migration timing to the
migration success of these stocks, i.e. the difference between the predicted and the observed
spawning escapement (difference between estimates, DBEs). DBE predictions based on the
upstream migration should be available prior to observing all the late run sockeye upstream to
be useful for marine fisheries management. Therefore, the upstream migration timing model
uses the historic relationship between the proportion upstream migration to-date and
upstream timing to predict the 50% migration date at Mission for Late run sockeye excluding
Birkenhead/Big Silver.

Introduction
Late run stocks excluding Birkenhead/Big Silver do not migrate immediately upstream. Instead, they
hold in the Strait of Georgia close to the mouth of the river before initiating up-river migration. Since
1995, Late run sockeye arrive in the Strait of Georgia at the normal time but migrate up the river earlier
than normal. There is a high mortality associated with this diverging behaviour resulting in a higher
observed DBE (difference between estimates) between potential spawning escapement based on
Mission estimates minus upstream catch and escapement on the spawning grounds (Macdonald et al.
2010). In order to mediate these en-route losses, additional fish are allowed to escape upriver of
Mission to account for anticipated DBEs, i.e., differences between in-season versus post-season
estimates of spawning escapement. The addition of fish to an escapement target for the purpose of
increasing the likelihood of achieving the spawning escapement target (SET) is called the Management
Adjustment (MA, Chapter B22). The Fraser River Panel relies on both in-season observations as well as
DBE predictions to derive appropriate MA estimates. For Late-run sockeye excluding Birkenhead/Big
Silver, the DBE run timing model in combination with the upstream migration timing model are used to
predict the DBE. The DBE run timing model uses the relationship between the historical 50% migration
date at Mission and the historical DBEs to make in-season DBE prediction. The in-season estimate of the
upstream migration date in turn is derived through the upstream migration timing model for Late run
sockeye excluding Birkenhead/Big Silver which relies on the historical relationship between the
percentage of upstream migration to date and the 50% migration date at Mission. The percentage
upstream migration to date indicates the proportion of the sockeye that continued their upstream
migration into the Fraser River and the sockeye that made it to the Strait of Georgia (Area 29).

198

In-season Assessments: Environmental information

Data
The historical differences between estimates (DBEs) and Mission 50% migration dates for Late run
sockeye are the primary data used in the DBE run timing model. Birkenhead/Big Silver stocks are
excluded from the Late run DBE and 50% migration data because they do not delay their upstream
migration. The Mission 50% migration timing relates to the date when 50% of the run will have passed
Mission. Additional data used to predict the upstream migration timing for Late-run excluding
Birkenhead/Big Silver are the reconstructed abundance estimates of these stocks in the Strait of
Georgia. Forward reconstructions predict abundances into the Strait of Georgia based on marine daily
abundances derived from stock-specific catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data and historical catchability
estimates of marine test fisheries combined with assumptions about migration speed (Chapter B18).
Dividing the total upstream migration to date by the total reconstructed abundance in the Strait of
Georgia to date gives an estimate of the proportion of upstream migration to date.

Methods
The DBE run timing model uses Mission timing as a predictive variable to predict the DBE. The DBE is
expressed as ln(PSE/SE), whereby PSE is the potential spawning escapement and SE is the actual
spawning escapement. The log transformation is required to meet the assumptions of homoscedasticity
(Zar 1996) and to restrict predictions to positive numbers. Upstream timing is described by the Mission
50% migration date. Higher (more negative) DBEs are associated with early upstream migration (Figure
1).

Figure 1. Relationship between %DBE and the Mission 50% migration date for Late Run sockeye
excluding Birkenhead/Big Silver.

In-season, the Mission 50% migration date is predicted by the upstream timing model. This model looks
at the historical relationship between the proportion of upstream migration to date and the post-season
50% migration date for Late-run excluding Birkenhead/Big Silver (Figure 2). The dependent value for the
upstream timing model is the 50% date at Mission. The predictive variable is the percentage of resident
fish reconstructed into the Strait of Georgia which have migrated past Mission on a given date. Earlier in
the season, predictions of upstream migration timing are more uncertain (lower R2) compared to later in
the season. The higher the proportion of upstream migration to date, the more precise the timing
estimate. Uncertainty around the upstream timing will impact the uncertainty around the resulting DBE
predictions.

Figure 2. Example of the relationship between the 50% date at Mission and the percentage of
resident fish reconstructed into the Gulf which have migrated past Mission on a given date.

The DBE run timing and upstream migration timing models incorporate uncertainty through the
application Bayesian estimation methods. Rather than providing the Fraser River Panel with a fixed DBE
prediction or 50% migration date at Mission through frequentist statistics, the use of Bayesian methods
allows the quantification of the uncertainty associated with the predictions (Ellison 1996). The Bayesian
regression models are run in Winbugs (Spiegelhalter et al. 2003) with an R-code interface (R Core Team
2013).

MODEL EVALUATION

DBE models and the derived Management Adjustment are used by managers to achieve spawning
escapement targets while maximizing harvest. Underestimates of in-river loss can lead to conservation
concerns if excess catch causes too few fish to reach spawning grounds, whereas overestimates of in-
river loss can result in foregone catch (Cummings et al. 2011). Various studies have evaluated the
performance of the DBE model (Cummings et al. 2011, Dionne et al. 2018) used to predict in-river loss
for Late run sockeye excluding Birkenhead/Big Silver. Cummings et al. (2011) found that MA forecast
based on the DBE model outperformed applying no MA at all.

Cummings et al. (2011) ranked the DBE run timing model for Late run sockeye as the best in terms of
hind cast criteria. This model performed better than models relying on temperature and discharge. But
the in-season uncertainty associated with the Mission migration date reduces the reliability of the
resulting DBE predictions. When the Late-run run-size is small, estimating delay can be even more
difficult.

Planned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement
The DFO EWatch group and PSC staff continue to work at improving the models and tools used to
estimate en-route loss given the cost to underestimate or overestimate in-river losses.

In-season Assessments: Fisheries Assessment

B26. Total Allowable Catch (TAC)

F.J. Martens

Summary
Available Total Allowable Catch (TAC) is an important pre-requisite for in-season fisheries. The
Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST), Chapter 4, describes the calculations for TAC for Fraser River
sockeye and pink salmon. TAC is calculated as the remaining portion of the annual aggregated
Fraser River sockeye and pink salmon abundance available after the spawning escapement
target, the Management Adjustment (sockeye only), the agreed Fraser River Aboriginal
Fisheries Exemption (AFE, sockeye only) and the expected catch in Panel-authorized test
fisheries are deducted. If there is a remaining portion of sockeye or pink salmon run size
available for harvest in Fraser Panel Area waters, the United States (U.S.) share shall not exceed
16.5 percent of the TAC for sockeye salmon and not exceed 25.7 percent of the TAC for pink
salmon. This calculation is subject to adjustments for harvest overages or underages from
previous years based on post-season catch estimates (see Chapter 4 Para 8(a to d) for details).
The remaining TAC in addition to AFE catches are assigned to Canada. This report also describes
the TAC-related decisions involving sockeye directed fisheries.

Introduction
While the Fraser River Panel’s primary objective is to reach Spawning Escapement Targets (SET) for
individual sockeye and pink salmon management units (MUs), its second objective is to achieve
international allocation of the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for both species (PST, Chapter 4). The Treaty
states that the U.S. share of the annual Fraser River sockeye and pink salmon Total Allowable Catch
(TAC) will not exceed 16.5 and 25.7 percent of the sockeye and pink salmon TAC, respectively. The
remaining available catch is deemed Canada’s share. The following document describes in detail the TAC
calculation as well as further adjustments and other considerations.

TAC CALCULATIONS

The four main deductions for calculating the TAC include the Spawning Escapement Target (Chapter A4),
the Management Adjustments (sockeye only) (Chapter B22), the Aboriginal Fisheries Exemption
(sockeye only) and the Panel approved test fishing catch (Chapter A5) (Table 1). Annually, Fisheries and
Oceans Canada (DFO) provides escapement targets and a sockeye spawning escapement plan for each
management group (MU) as per Chapter 4, paragraph 3 of the PST. For each MU, the TAM (Total
Allowable Mortality) rules that account for both fishing and natural mortality due to adverse
environmental conditions are incorporated to ensure sufficient fish reach the spawning grounds.
Although the TAM rule defines the target levels, these levels can be further increased if the Panel
decides there are other competing factors that would preclude the SETs from being reached. These
factors are natural, environmental or stock assessment factors and for the purposes of the TAC
calculation are referred to as Management Adjustments (MAs, MacDonald et al. 2010). MAs are
additional fish added to the SET for the purpose of increasing the likelihood of achieving the SET. When
the SET is increased by the MA, the resulting target is referred to as the adjusted SET (Table 1). In case
the sum of the SET and MA exceeds the forecasted or in-season estimated run size, the adjusted SET is
capped to match that run size estimate (e.g. in the case of Early Stuart in 2018). For pink salmon the
escapement plan provided by DFO does not change based on in-season migration conditions.

In addition to the adjusted SET, the Treaty also defines an Aboriginal Fisheries Exemption (AFE) of up to
400,000 sockeye, set aside for Canadian in-river and marine area Aboriginal fisheries (i.e. for First
Nations opportunities to harvest salmon for Food, Social and Ceremonial (FSC) purposes). The AFE is also
deducted from the total run size prior to determining the TAC for international sharing. As the TAC is

calculated by stock management group (Early Stuart, Early Summer, Summer and Late run), the AFE
needs to be allocated across these four groups. For Early Stuart the exemption is up to 20% of the AFE,
and the AFE for the remaining management groups is based on the average proportional distribution of
First Nations harvests for the most recent three cycles, modified annually as required. If pre-season or
in-season there is insufficient harvestable surplus in any management group to allow achieving the AFE
allocation for that management group, then the AFE distribution is adjusted so that AFE for that
management group is the greater of the catch, the projected catch by Aboriginal fisheries or the
available harvestable surplus. Lastly, any test fishing catch from Panel approved test fisheries is also
removed from the total run size when calculating the available TAC for international sharing. There are
no MAs or AFEs for pink salmon.

Once the TAC is defined for each of the four MUs, the U.S. share is based on the aggregate TAC, i.e.,
across the four MUs. To the extent practicable, the Panel shall develop and implement a fishing plan
that provides the U.S. fishery with the opportunity to harvest its 16.5 percent aggregate share of the
TAC of Fraser River sockeye and its 25.7 percent share of the Fraser River pink salmon TAC. To
accomplish this, the Panel shall take into consideration the availability of both the sockeye salmon TAC
and pink salmon TAC, through the entire fishing season, while to the extent practical, minimizing the
impacts on overlapping of sockeye management groups with little or no TAC. To do this the Panel strives
to develop and implement fishing plans that concentrate U.S. fisheries on the most abundant MU(s), i.e.,
the ones that provide the largest percentage of the available TAC. To the extent practicable the harvest
should be distributed evenly across the available TAC for each MU however, given that the proportion of
migration of different MUs through U.S. waters on any given year may be variable, this may result in
more than 16.5 percent of the TAC for one or more of the less abundant MUs (see Chapter 4 Para 3e for
details). In addition, some of the less abundant management groups may even have no TAC. To allow
access to the TAC of the more abundant management group, some incidental harvest may occur on the
overlapping MUs that may have little or no TAC. Bycatch on a MU with little or no TAC is defined by the
low abundance exploitation rate (LAER) which limits the exploitation rate of that group to a small
amount (%) as defined by Canada’s preseason spawning escapement plan. Managing to a LAER situation
typically occurs for one of the following reasons: when the run size is below the lower fisheries
reference point (Pestal et al. 2008), when the adjusted SET (SET + MA) is greater than the run size or
when the adjusted SET is less than the run size, but the resulting TAC is small enough for the exploitation
rate to be less than the LAER. For example, in 2018 there was no international TAC for Early Stuart
sockeye, but fisheries on Early Summer run resulted in a small catch of Early Stuart fish in U.S. fisheries
(Table 1). This by-catch was still below the defined LAER of 10% for the Early Stuart management group
in 2018.

ADJUSTMENTS TO TAC CALCULATIONS

Adjustments are made to the U.S. share of the TAC in the case of previous-year(s) harvest overages
(more fish caught than allocated share) or underages (less fish caught than allocated share from the
previous year(s) (see Chapter 4 Para 8(a to b) for details). Currently, there are no adjustments for
overages that are a result of TAC reductions after the scheduling of the last Panel approved U.S. fishery
of the season or for any harvest of Fraser River sockeye that occurs in Alaska (see Chapter 4 Para 8(c to
d) for details). Adjustments for underages are made if Canada directly impedes the US from obtaining its
share of the TAC, but not because the U.S. failed to deploy sufficient effort or fish were not accessible to
U.S. fisheries due to northern migration patterns or harvesting constraints. Adjustments, for previous
year overages or underages, are limited so that the resulting TAC is not reduced by more than 5% or
increased by more than 15% unless the Panel deems otherwise. If in a given year there is an overage or
underage, from a previous season, to be carried forward but no available TAC, by Panel agreement, the
overage or underage is carried forward to the subsequent year(s). Any residual overage or underage on

204

In-season Assessments: Fisheries Assessment

the last year of the Chapter (i.e., 2028) will be carried forward to the next Chapter Period. Reasons for
adjustments include the following: (1) management imprecision in U.S. fisheries (2) Canada impeding
the U.S. from pursuing its in-season share.

OTHER TAC CONSIDERATIONS

Currently, the Panel considers four different sockeye management groups (Early Stuart, Early Summer,
Summer and Late run) to derive SETs and the aggregated TAC. The Panel can however assign additional
management groups by mutual decision (Chapter 4 para 2f of PST). For example, prior to 2010, the
Birkenhead group formed a fifth management group. Should additional management groups be
assigned, then the TAC calculation applies in a similar fashion as for the four management groups.

As agreed to by the Parties in Chapter 4 of the Treaty, Alaska District 104 catches are excluded from the
TAC calculation. Fraser River sockeye incidentally caught in District 104 fisheries directed at pink salmon
comprise a small portion of the catch in that fishery and are not considered to be the target
species/stock. As a result, this catch is not included in the TAC calculation but is included in the post-
season estimate of total run size.

ESSR catch (escapement surplus to spawning requirement) is also excluded from the TAC table. This is
catch from a Canadian fishery that occurs in terminal areas (e.g., Weaver Creek sockeye). As these fish
are ‘in excess’ of the spawning requirement (Garner and Parfitt 2006), they are not included in the
exploitation rate as this would unnecessarily inflate the exploitation rate and indicate an inaccurate
portrayal of in-season management of harvest. As a result, this catch is not included in the Canadian
catch in the TAC table (DFO 1999).

In addition to the Alaska and ESSR catch not included in the TAC calculation, Fisheries Induced
Mortalities (FIMs) are also not included (Michielsens et al. 2019). FIMs are a component of the catch
that is released (non-retention), and some of these released fish are expected to die due to the stress of
capture and handling. Although the mortality associated with this catch is not included in the TAC
calculation it is included for the calculation of the exploitation rate which may limit access to TAC.

FISHERIES EVALUATIONS IN RELATION TO SOCKEYE TAC

Available TAC is an important pre-requisite for in-season fisheries. Once the panel adopts in-season run
size and MA estimates for the different management groups, the TAC table (Figure 1) is adjusted to take
into account the newly adjusted SETs. In addition, updated catch numbers in the TAC table will include
both catches of fisheries that have concluded as well as preliminary catch estimates for ongoing
fisheries. The remaining available TAC for sockeye will determine if additional sockeye directed fisheries
will be allowed to take place. When there is TAC available for all fisheries management groups impacted
by the proposed fishery, TAC is the main consideration. In case there is no TAC for one of the
overlapping management groups, this group will be managed under a LAER, and for a U.S. fishery under
this scenario to be approved, the resulting catches of the U.S fisheries proposal should be deemed small
but acceptable by the parties.

Purse Seine (PS): A net that can be drawn into the shape of a bag using the line along the bottom of the
net like the drawstring of a purse.

Reconstruction: Forward reconstructions predict daily escapement into the river based on marine daily
abundance estimates while backward reconstructions add marine and lower river daily catches to daily
escapement estimates to reconstruct daily abundances in marine areas.

Recreational fishing (sport fishing): Non-commercial fishing as a leisure activity or to provide food for
personal consumption.

Recruit: A salmon that survives to maturity is considered a “recruit” from its parent generation, or brood
year.

Recruits per spawner (R/S, RS): A measure of productivity of a population or stock. The number of
salmon surviving to maturity per each adult salmon that successfully spawned in the freshwater
spawning grounds.

Reef net (RN): A net suspended between two boats. The net is anchored for stability.

212

Resorption: The physical wearing down of the scales from the environmental stress of moving from
marine waters to freshwater waters. It makes the scale difficult to age as the perimeter of the scale is
worn away.

Return year: The year in which an individual salmon returns to freshwater with intent to spawn.

Ricker model: Model describing the density-dependent population dynamics between the number of
spawners and recruits.

Run size: The total number of returning adult salmon prior to being impacted by fisheries en-route to
the spawning grounds.

Run timing group: One of four Fraser River sockeye management group characterized by different
timing of their migration to the Fraser River: Early Stuart, Early Summer, Summer and Late run.

Scale: Thin plate of keratinized protein that grows continuously on the skin of a fish

Scale pattern analysis: Using the circuli to determine patterns in scale growth used for aging and
determining origin of salmon

Set net: Gillnet anchored in position rather than drifted.

Single nuclear polymorphism (SNP): a genetic marker with alleles that differ at a single nucleotide base

Smolt: Life history stage where the young salmon are typically rearing in lakes or rivers (1-2 years). Time
when the freshwater zone circuli are laid down. In late winter, the fish begin the change which will adapt
them to marine life (smolting or smoltifying). Spring sees the smolts move towards marine waters.

Spawner: Adult salmon that successfully migrate from marine environments to freshwater spawning
grounds and have the opportunity to reproduce, after avoiding natural mortality and harvest.

Spawning Escapement (SE): Spawning escapement of adult male and female spawners and jack
spawners (precocious age 3 males) as estimated through assessment programs conducted on the
spawning grounds or projected from other data when such programs are not conducted.

Spawning Escapement Plan: The sockeye escapement plan specifies escapement requirements that vary
with run size for each management group and includes an abundance below which there are very
limited directed harvests allowed and a total mortality cap.

Spawning escapement target (SET): Target for total adult spawning escapement for each spawning
population as defined each year by Canada’s Spawning Escapement Plan.

Split-beam: Quarterly separation of received echoes by 4 quadrants of the transducer plate.

Spread: Number of days encompassing 95% of a stock’s migration.

Spring growth: Area on the scale where lake (lacustrine) growth ends and sea growth begins, composed
of circuli which are intermediate in width. An area of freshwater circuli that indicates growth after the
last freshwater annulus has been formed. Highly variable between stocks.

Stock: A genetically distinct population of salmon, spawning at similar times and location.

Stock assessment: Use of statistical and mathematical calculations to estimate fish abundance as well as
the impact of fisheries management decisions on fish abundance.

Summer run: One of the four sockeye management groups returning to the Fraser River after the Early
Summer run and prior to the Late run.

213

Target strength (TS): A decibel measure of the backscattering cross section of a target (relative to 1m2)
that can be used to measure the acoustic size of a target.

Time-density model: In-season run size assessment model that estimates allows to estimate run size
and migration timing based on the proportion of the migration on a given date.

Transducer: A piezoelectric device usually built from certain types of ceramics that transforms electrical
energy to mechanical energy and vice versa. In other words, an acoustic transducer converts electric
signal into an acoustic signal via vibrations of a ceramic element, and then receives the incoming sound
wave and converts it back into an electric signal.

Transect sampling: Sampling from a mobile platform along pre-set routes.

Troll (TR): Fishing by trailing a baited line along behind a boat.

Total Allowable Catch (TAC): The abundance of sockeye available to be caught after spawning and other
requirements have been subtracted from the run size.

Total Allowable Mortality (TAM): For each Fraser sockeye management group at different run sizes,
Canada’s Spawning Escapement Plan specifies the Total Allowable Mortality from all sources, including
catches through fishery removals and en route mortality, represented by the Management Adjustment.

Total Allowable Mortality (TAM) cap: Maximum amount of Total Allowable Mortality.

Univariate method: A statistical method that use only a single independent variable in the analysis.

Whatman Sheet: Filter paper used from drying and preserving DNA samples.
