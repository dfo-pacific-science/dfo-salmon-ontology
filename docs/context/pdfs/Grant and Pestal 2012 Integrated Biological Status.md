ABSTRACT

The 24 Fraser Sockeye Conservation Units (CUs) were used as case studies to explore
methods of status integration for Strategy 1 of the Wild Salmon Policy (WSP): Standardized
Monitoring of Wild Salmon Status. Although most of these Fraser Sockeye case studies
represent data rich CUs in the Pacific Region, with long time series of stock-recruitment data, a
few CUs are also data limited (e.g. Chilliwack-ES only has some recent spawner abundance
data).

Status integration was evaluated during a three day technical workshop, which included the
development of both final integrated status for each Fraser Sockeye CU (which include one or
more WSP status zones) and commentaries on the information used to assess status. For the
workshop, two page standardized data summaries were produced for each Fraser Sockeye CU
case study. Data summaries included WSP biological status information for a number of metrics
(e.g. relative abundance, short-term trends in abundance, and long-term trends in abundance)
and other biological data relevant to their interpretation. Case studies were evaluated ‘blind’,
with generic labels rather than CU names. The decision to evaluate case studies ‘blind’ was
made to facilitate the development of a standardized WSP status integration approach, to focus
discussion on the metrics presented in Grant et al. (2011) for status integration, and to facilitate
discussion between experts with detailed local and CU-specific knowledge and those with
broader salmonid and status evaluation experience.

Each CU case study was evaluated first in small group sessions (four to six participants per
group) and, subsequently, in plenary sessions (all 34 workshop participants). On the final day of
the workshop, the integrated status for each CU, developed in the previous days’ plenary
sessions, were re-visited with the goal to narrow down a CU’s status to a final single status
zone (where possible), and to fine tune commentaries. Also on the final day of the workshop,
CU names were revealed to provide participants with the opportunity to introduce any specific
supplementary information that might support a change in integrated status designation or that
could be added to the CU status commentaries.

Integrated status results from this workshop complete WSP status determinations for Fraser
Sockeye, which follows up on the recently published exploration of uncertainty in WSP status
metrics for these CUs. Final statuses for the 24 Fraser Sockeye CUs included the following:
seven Red, four Red/Amber, four Amber, two Amber/Green, five Green, one “Data Deficient”,
and one “Undetermined”. Detailed status results amongst groups and expert commentary
(which identified key metrics and associated data that guided these status determinations) are
also summarized, and are necessary for CU status interpretation in WSP Strategy 4: Integrated
Strategic Planning.

Although each group moved through the CU summary information in different sequences, there
was considerable similarity amongst groups regarding which considerations drove their final
status determinations.

RÉSUMÉ

Les 24 unités de conservation (UC) du saumon rouge du fleuve Fraser ont servi d'études de
cas dans l'examen des méthodes d'intégration de l'état pour la Stratégie 1 de la Politique
concernant le saumon sauvage (PSS) : Contrôle normalisé de la situation du saumon sauvage.
Dans la plupart des études de cas portant sur le saumon rouge du fleuve Fraser, les UC de la
région du Pacifique sont documentées par un riche ensemble de données, notamment des
séries de données de stock-recrutement collectées de longue date; cependant, pour certaines
UC, on dispose de peu de données (p. ex., seules quelques données récentes sur l'abondance
des reproducteurs sont disponibles pour Chilliwack-DE).

L'intégration de l'état a été évaluée pendant un atelier technique de trois jours, qui visait
notamment à mettre au point les désignations d'état intégré définitives pour chaque UC du
saumon rouge du fleuve Fraser (comprenant une ou plusieurs zones d'état de la PSS) et à
commenter les renseignements utilisés pour évaluer l'état. Pour l'atelier, on a produit des
sommaires de données normalisés de deux pages pour chaque UC du saumon rouge du fleuve
Fraser. Ces documents contenaient des renseignements sur l'état biologique de la PSS pour
plusieurs paramètres (p. ex., abondance relative, tendances de l'abondance à court et à long
terme) et d'autres données biologiques pertinentes pour leur interprétation. Les études de cas
ont été évaluées en aveugle et, pour ce faire, portaient des titres génériques et non le nom des
UC. La décision a été prise d'évaluer les études de cas en aveugle pour élaborer une méthode
normalisée d'intégration de l'état selon la PSS, pour axer la discussion sur les paramètres
présentés dans Grant et al. (2011) aux fins d'intégration de l'état et pour faciliter la discussion
entre spécialistes jouissant d'une connaissance précise de certaines UC en particulier et ceux
ayant une expérience plus large des salmonidés et de l'évaluation de l'état.

On a d'abord évalué les études de cas de chaque UC dans des séances en petits groupes
(quatre à six participants) et, par la suite, dans des séances plénières (avec les 34 participants
à l'atelier). Le dernier jour de l'atelier, on a réexaminé l'état intégré de chaque UC, mis au point
pendant les séances plénières des jours précédents, afin de réduire l'état de chaque UC à une
seule zone d'état définitif si possible, et de préciser les commentaires sur l'état. Le dernier jour
de l'atelier également, les noms des UC ont été présentés pour donner aux participants la
possibilité d'ajouter toute information qui pourrait étayer la nécessité de modifier la désignation
de l'état intégré ou que l'on pourrait ajouter aux commentaires sur l'état de l'UC.

Les résultats relatifs à l'état intégré obtenus lors de cet atelier complètent les déterminations
des états de la PSS pour le saumon rouge du fleuve Fraser, faisant suite à une analyse publiée
récemment sur les incertitudes entourant les paramètres d'état de la PSS pour ces UC. Les
états définitifs des 24 UC du saumon rouge du fleuve Fraser se répartissaient comme suit : sept
Rouge, quatre Rouge/Ambre, quatre Ambre, deux Ambre/Vert, cinq Vert, un « Données
insuffisantes » et un « Indéterminé ». Les résultats détaillés de l'état de chaque groupe et les
commentaires des spécialistes (qui ont défini les paramètres clés et les données connexes
ayant orienté la détermination des états) sont aussi résumés séparément et sont nécessaires
pour interpréter l'état des UC dans la Stratégie 4 de la PSS.

Bien que chaque groupe ait pris connaissance des sommaires concernant les UC selon des
séquences différentes, on a constaté une forte similitude entre les facteurs qui ont amené les
groupes à déterminer les états définitifs.

INTRODUCTION

The biological status of each Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) Conservation Unit (CU) is evaluated
using a number of metrics (Holt et al. 2009), which could each indicate a different WSP status
zone from Red (poor status) to Green (healthy status). For example, the WSP metric for recent
trend in abundance could indicate a CU’s status is poor, while conversely, the long-term trend
metric could indicate the same CU’s status is healthy. In cases where metric information is
contradictory, provision of this metric-specific status information alone does not provide
complete scientific advice to fisheries management. Instead, a final step that synthesizes all
metric and status-related information into a final integrated status for each CU, and provides
expert commentary on this information, is necessary as inputs into fisheries management
processes to prioritize assessment activities and management actions (Table 1).

A number of Action Steps identified for WSP Strategy 1 (Standardized Monitoring of Wild
Salmon Status) have recently been completed, and the results from this work are foundational
to this final status integration step. First, Pacific Salmon CUs, as the fundamental biological unit
required to maintain salmon biodiversity, have been identified (Holtby & Ciruna 2007).
Subsequently, a suite of metrics that fall into four classes of indicators (abundance, trends in
abundance, distribution and fishing mortality) were recommended for WSP biological status
evaluations (Figure 2; Holt et al. 2009); these WSP metric recommendations were based on
analysis from a number of publications (Holt 2009; Porszt 2009; Holt 2010; Holt & Bradford
2011; Porszt et al. 2012). To assess each CU’s WSP biological status, a number of metrics are
selected from this suite of possible metrics, depending on the data availability and applicability
to a particular CU. Status for each selected metric is evaluated by comparing the biological
state of the CU to metric-specific lower and upper benchmarks, which delineate, respectively,
the Red (poor status) to Amber, and Amber to Green (healthy status) WSP status zones (Table
2; Figure 1).

One of the first groups of CUs to be evaluated under WSP Strategy 1 is Fraser Sockeye Salmon
(Oncorhynchus nerka) (Grant et al. 2011). Although most of these CUs are data rich, with long
time series of stock-recruitment data, a few Fraser Sockeye CUs are also data limited (e.g.
Chilliwack-ES only has some recent spawner abundance data). Wild Salmon Policy Strategy 1,
Action Steps 1.1 (the identification of CUs), 1.2 (the development of criteria to assess CUs and
identify benchmarks to represent biological statuses), and 1.3 (CU status assessment), were
adapted and updated specifically for 22 current and 2 de novo  Fraser Sockeye CUs (Grant et
al. 2011). For Fraser Sockeye CUs, WSP indicators used to evaluate uncertainty in biological
status included abundance (one metric) and trends in abundance (three metrics) (Grant et al.
2011). The relative-abundance metric, in particular, was evaluated across a range of
benchmarks (estimated across different model forms and probability levels), which compared
two different calculations of the average recent abundance (geometric versus arithmetic mean)
against paired sets of upper and lower benchmarks. The fishing mortality class of indicator
described in Holt et al (2009) was not used in Fraser Sockeye status evaluations, as this
indicator is only used when abundance data are not available. In the case of Fraser Sockeye,
however, all CUs have a relatively complete time series of escapement and recruitment data.
The WSP distribution class of indicator comprises a CU’s freshwater spawning distribution only,
and was not assessed for Fraser Sockeye because escapement enumeration methods
generally do not provide the flexibility to assess distributional changes through time. Further,
Fraser Sockeye CUs occupy a relatively small freshwater distribution, limited to their rearing
lakes or spawning rivers, compared to species such as the Fraser Pink (odd year) CU that
occupies the entire Fraser watershed (Holtby & Ciruna 2007). Therefore, current WSP

 1

distribution metrics are considered not as relevant to Fraser Sockeye CUs, compared to other
species of Pacific salmon.

Since several metrics (abundance and trends in abundance) were used to assess status for
each Fraser Sockeye CU, and uncertainties in abundance benchmarks were considered (Grant
et al. 2011), different metrics could indicate divergent biological statuses ranging from Red to
Green, depending on the CU. Therefore, integration of the statuses for each metric and across
uncertainties in abundance benchmarks for each Fraser Sockeye CU is a useful final step in
Strategy 1 (Action Step 1.3: CU status assessment).

For Pacific Salmon CUs, WSP biological status integration methods have not previously been
developed. Although other organizations also integrate biological status across multiple criteria,
such as the Committee of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) and the World
Conservation Union (IUCN), their approaches are not specific to Pacific Salmon and, therefore,
rely on different criteria (i.e. metrics) to assess status, and use a combination of status
designation guidelines and expert judgment to assign a risk category. Within DFO, a synoptic
approach is being developed to use similar (but not identical) metrics to the WSP to assess the
status of all 450+ CUs simultaneously. This approach does not make any definitive conclusions
on status, but rather is a rapid prioritization tool. Since the synoptic assessment statuses are not
equivalent to WSP statuses, and integration approaches are designed to be rapid and
automatic, these approaches cannot be applied to the more comprehensive WSP status
assessments. Another project, which specifically explores WSP status integration, is being
conducted as part of a thesis project through the School of Resource and Environmental
Management at Simon Fraser University (E. Brunet, SFU, pers. comm.). The goal of this thesis
project, however, is not to develop decision rules for WSP status integration or to integrate
status for specific CUs, but to use broad hypothetical scenarios to evaluate expert choice when
integrating status across metrics.

In the absence of existing WSP-specific status integration approaches, a Canadian Science
Advisory Secretariat (CSAS) technical workshop (comprised of Pacific Salmon Stock
Assessment experts) was conducted to explore WSP status integration using Fraser Sockeye
CUs as case studies. An additional goal of the workshop was to finalize integrated statuses for
the 24 Fraser Sockeye CUs. For each CU, the final integrated status could include one status
zone, or a combination of status zones, and commentary on the information used to assess
status. The current paper provides the following details on WSP status integration using Fraser
Sockeye CUs as case studies:

commentary relating to aspects that were not recorded or discussed in plenary sessions at the
workshop itself could not be addressed within the context of this paper (e.g. proposed additional
analyses).

METHODS

2.1

INTERNAL DFO MEETING: INITIAL SCOPING EXERCISE

In preparation for the WSP Status Integration Workshop, a preliminary internal (DFO) meeting
was held to explore WSP status integration using six unnamed Fraser Sockeye CUs as case
studies. The six case studies represented the range of metrics used and statuses observed for
the 24 Fraser Sockeye CUs presented in Grant et al. (2011). This meeting was not intended to
provide final integrated statuses for these six CU case studies, nor develop a set of decision
rules for status integration, but rather explore tools and approaches to biological status
integration. The scoping meeting was held at the Pacific Biological Station on June 10, 2011
and included 15 DFO participants with technical expertise on Pacific Salmon stock assessment.

Prior to the small internal status integration meeting, interviews were conducted by meeting
organizers to familiarize participants with the standardized data summaries produced for each
of the six CU cases, and to solicit feedback on WSP status integration methods. Data
summaries included the standardized presentation of WSP metrics and population abundance
trends for each CU. At the meeting, each participant was assigned to one of three groups (5
participants per group). Each group independently worked through each case study to assign
an integrated status, and to record the rationale for their final status. The meeting ended in a
broader group discussion on each group’s final status for each CU case study, and the
similarities and differences in their status designations and approaches.

Participants agreed that the general meeting approach, using independent group work paired
with broader full group plenary sessions, worked effectively to generate integrated CU statuses,
and to begin to develop guidelines for status integration. Despite the variety of integration
approaches used by groups, final CU statuses amongst groups converged for four out of the six
CUs. For the integrated statuses developed at this meeting, groups used a combination of the
individual metric results and information on abundance and productivity trends presented in the
data summaries. No one metric alone was used to determine an overall status designation. For
future integration processes, participants flagged a number of issues specifically related to the
relative-abundance metric. First, appropriate estimation of benchmarks using model forms that
consider separately, time varying productivity (i.e. Kalman filter Ricker model and smoothed
Ricker model) and delay-density interactions (i.e. Larkin model), were questioned by
participants. Second, the appropriate method to estimate the current abundance state of a CU
(different methods of averaging the most recent four years of escapement data), used for the
evaluation of abundance metric status, was also debated. As a result, meeting participants
recommended further work on relative-abundance-metric benchmarks and methods for
averaging current state of the CUs abundance. In addition, participants also recommended the
inclusion of two additional metrics, productivity trends and absolute abundance, not included in
the original WSP status evaluation toolkit (Holt et al. 2009), in future status integration
processes. Overall, this smaller meeting provided the foundation for the CSAS Workshop using
all 24 Fraser Sockeye CUs as case studies.

2.2  WORKSHOP ORGANIZING COMMITTEE

To build on momentum established in the smaller internal DFO meeting that explored WSP
status integration, an internal organizing committee was subsequently established to support
planning for the WSP Status Integration CSAS Workshop. The organizing committee included
representatives from two broad categories: senior management in DFO Science and Fisheries
Management sectors, and technical experts on Pacific Salmon stock assessment. Members of
the organizing committee represented 11 out of the 34 workshop participants. A total of six half

 3

or full-day planning meetings occurred from September 7 through to November 11, 2011, and
these meetings varied from process to technically-oriented, drawing on different components of
the organizing committee complement.

From a process perspective, key issues that were addressed by the organizing committee
included the following: identification of a workshop Chair, dates, venue, invitees, terms of
reference, agenda, broader WSP communication pieces (e.g. biological benchmarks versus
reference points, WSP Strategy 1, linkages to other WSP Strategies) and linkages to similar
status processes (DFO synoptic survey, COSEWIC status designation process, and Simon
Fraser’s E. Brunet’s thesis on WSP status integration).

From a technical perspective, key issues addressed by the organizing committee included the
following: design of the standardized data packages for each CU, information included in
participant binders, workshop posters, and presentations, and issues previously flagged by DFO
internal status integration meeting participants on the relative-abundance metric (e.g.
identification of cyclic CUs, use of Larkin model-derived benchmarks for cyclic CUs, and the
appropriate approach for averaging recent generation abundances for comparison to
benchmarks).

2.3

PRE-WORKSHOP INTERVIEWS

Prior to the CSAS workshop, participants were offered a pre-workshop interview. Through the
interviews, participants learned exactly what to expect from the workshop (format, available
data, and templates to be used), and organizers found out what to expect from participants (e.g.
concerns about process and questions about technical details). The main advantage of
conducting pre-workshop interviews was to minimize the time spent at the workshop orienting
participants to background materials and process, in order to focus workshop time on the actual
status evaluations. Interviews were also an additional communication tool, which was built upon
using other media (posters, binder tabs, and presentations) at the actual workshop.

Prior to the interview, participants received via email six electronic PDF files, which included the
following:

1)  a workshop outline: one page on the general approach of break-out group and plenary

sessions to evaluate status integration methods and final Fraser Sockeye CU integrated
statuses;

2)  Status Integration Workshop Terms of Reference (See Appendix A in DFO 2012 a);

3)  case study template: standardized information sheet to be filled in by each group during

the break-out group session, to document their status integration decision-making
process (see Appendix E of DFO 2012 a);

4)  status results template: used by meeting organizers to record final status integration
results, which include individual group statuses, final plenary status, and rationale for
status (see Appendix F of DFO 2012 a);

5)  example CU (unnamed) data summary: to provide participants with an idea of data

summary format and information;

6)  guide to data summary: provides a ‘road map’ describing the information presented in

the data summaries (Appendix 1).

For consistency amongst participant interviews, and also to facilitate synthesis of pre-workshop
feedback provided by participants, most interviews were conducted by the same workshop
organizer. Each interview generally followed the same order in which the documents are

 4

presented above (from 1 to 6), although the order and emphasis varied depending on the
specific interests of each participant. The following questions were specifically asked of
participants during their interviews: 1) how should status assessments be combined across
different metrics and model assumptions; 2) how should uncertainty in abundance metrics be
considered (e.g. alternative estimates of lower benchmarks); 3) how should data quality be
considered in the status evaluation; and 4) how should additional information be considered in
status integration? Participants’ responses were recorded by the interviewer and provided to
each participant after their interview for their review.

Feedback received through pre-workshop interviews greatly assisted the organizing committee
with planning for the workshop. In general, respondents raised many of the same issues that
were debated at the internal DFO meeting in June, and that would later come up again as
challenges at the workshop. Based on responses in the pre-workshop interviews, the organizing
team revised the case study data summaries, prepared additional background presentations for
delivery at the workshop to clarify commonly raised question, and developed supplementary
reference materials (see DFO 2012 a). The responses also helped the meeting Chair with
preparing facilitation strategies.

The following process-related issues came up consistently during the interviews:

  What are the next steps following the status integration workshop? Specifically, what
happens with the results of this workshop, and how frequently will status be re-
assessed?







Clarification on the difference between assessing current CU status, which
incorporates a variety of information (e.g. uncertainty in estimates of biological
benchmarks), and choosing a single formal benchmark for subsequent management
process (such as the development of management reference points) was required.
This workshop dealt with status evaluation only.

A few respondents questioned the use of ‘blind’ case studies, suggesting that knowing
the name of each CU up front is important to the status integration process.

Consistency in integrated status approaches was a recurring concern amongst
participants interviewed. Specifically, there were concerns regarding how consistent
integrated status designations would be between the current and future expert
assessment groups and also between the current WSP integration approach and other
assessment processes (particularly COSEWIC, given WSP lower benchmarks are set
to include a buffer to COSEWIC designations).

The following technical issues were raised consistently during the interviews:





The broader applicability of the status integration approaches developed in the
workshop was also questioned by respondents, since Fraser Sockeye CU data
availability and analytical effort are high compared to most other Pacific Salmon CUs.

Respondents also questioned how additional information (e.g. productivity pattern, total
recruits pattern, habitat condition, exploitation rate, etc.), in addition to WSP metric-
specific status information, would be used to develop integrated statuses.

2.4

STANDARDIZED CU DATA SUMMARIES

For the workshop, two-page standardized data summaries were produced for each Fraser
Sockeye CU (Appendices 1 & 2). Data summaries represented a critical step in the status
integration process, by standardizing status-related information presented for each CU. Other

 5

detailed information on CU biology or CU-specific habitat and/or ecosystem threats was
excluded from these data summaries (and, therefore, from Fraser Sockeye CU status
integration). This level of detail was considered by the workshop organizing committee
unnecessary for WSP Strategy 1 status evaluations, but instead may be a requirement for the
subsequent processes when more detailed assessments may be conducted (Table 1). The
presentation of the information deemed critical by workshop organizers to status evaluations
was optimized within a two-page data summary lay-out (see Appendix 1 for guide to data
summaries). Constraining data summaries to two pages and using a consistent lay-out of
status-related information across CUs, ensures the integration processes is efficient
(participants only have to learn the lay-out once when they work through the first CU case
study), and standardized (depending on data availability, the same pieces of information are
provided for each CU).

Data and status results were updated from Grant et al. (2011) to include 2010 escapement
information. These data summaries included the following (see Appendices 1 & 2):

status information for up to four WSP metrics: one metric for abundance relative to
biological benchmarks, one metric for long-term trend in abundance, and two metrics
for short-term trend in abundance (note: relative-abundance metrics could not be
evaluated for CUs without recruitment data or carrying-capacity data)

presentation of both structural (i.e. model form) and stochastic (i.e. unexplained
recruitment variation) uncertainty in estimates of biological benchmarks and the
resulting uncertainty in the status indicated by the relative-abundance metric

presentation of relative-abundance metric statuses evaluated using either geometric or
arithmetic averages of recent abundances

qualitative summary of overall data quality

time series plots of productivity (recruits/spawner and time-varying estimates of the
Ricker model productivity parameter)

time series plots of spawner escapements

table of absolute abundances relative to COSEWIC criteria D1 for small populations

retrospective (historical) time series of status for each WSP metric

supplementary plots included fishing mortality and total recruits

Data summaries were revised from the earlier version used at the June 2011 internal DFO
status integration meeting, based on recommendations from participants at this internal
meeting, feedback from pre-workshop interviews with participants, and subsequent organizing
committee discussions. Key changes to the data summaries included treatment of salmon
escapement data used in both the figures of abundance trends and in the methods used to
average current escapements for the relative-abundance metric. Additional revisions to the data
summaries included the addition of absolute abundance and productivity trends data and
updates to the benchmark results for cyclic CUs.

Workshop organizers agreed that Pacific salmon abundance data are lognormally distributed,
with spawner escapements occurring most frequently at low to moderate abundances relative to
the less frequent very large abundances. Therefore, the appropriate way to view this data is in
loge scale, which down weights the less frequent large abundance years visually in plots.
Plotting salmon escapement data in loge space, therefore, does not mislead the analyst into
over-emphasizing the infrequent large escapement years when interpreting abundance trends.
However, in addition to presenting loge scale escapement in the data summaries, natural scale

 6

plots were also included to avoid road blocks for workshop participants not familiar with working
in loge space and to visualize the full magnitude of fluctuations over time.

For abundance metric status evaluations, Holt et al (2009) recommended using the geometric
mean of the current generation escapement, rather than the arithmetic mean. Similar to plotting
abundance data in loge scale, geometric averages are also considered more appropriate for
summarizing log-normally distributed salmon abundance data. Although geometric versus
arithmetic means of recent escapements are similar to one another for non-cyclic CUs,
comprised of four consecutive years of relatively equal abundance, means of cyclic CU recent
escapements (comprised of four consecutive years of very different abundances), are quite
different between approaches. In particular, geometric means produce much lower averages
compared to the arithmetic mean for cyclic CUs. There remain some questions regarding the
differences in averaging four years of salmon abundances, where each year represents a
relatively separate population of the same CU, rather than four unique years of changing total
CU abundance. For comparison, many other species populations are spatially, not temporally
isolated, and the total population is represented by the sum of all populations. For Pacific
Salmon, perhaps the temporally separated populations should be similarly summed, although
more work is required to address this.

In addition to discussion regarding appropriate data treatment for Fraser Sockeye CUs, the
model form (i.e. Larkin model) specifically used to describe population dynamics for the cyclic
CUs was also updated. Although the Larkin model has been recommended to describe
population dynamics for cyclic CUs more appropriately than the typically used Ricker model,
appropriate estimation of relative-abundance-metric benchmarks has been challenging given
the complexity of the Larkin model, compared to the Ricker model. Larkin derived relative-
abundance benchmarks were not provided in Grant et al. (2011), due to these computational
challenges, however, further work was conducted in preparation for the workshop, and these
benchmarks were included for specific CUs. Larkin-model derived benchmarks were provided at
the workshop for seven CUs identified as cyclic.

These CUs for the set of cyclic case studies were selected based on a combination of three
considerations: relative goodness-of-fit for Larkin-type models compared to Ricker-type models,
expert opinion on the life history of each CU, and visual inspection of the observed patterns in
abundance. Our classification into seven highly cyclic CU and 17 non-cyclic CUs was
considered a pragmatic approach by the DFO stock assessment biologists & scientists who
participated in the workshop planning process, and is supported by the following additional
considerations:

  The question asked of participants was a broad one “How does a highly cyclic pattern in
abundance affect your interpretation of status information?” rather than the more narrow
“Which SR model fits best for this CU, and what is the appropriate method for estimating
a lower benchmark based on this SR model?” For example, the challenges of
interpreting short-term trends, identifying a meaningful measure of generational average,
or comparing observed abundances to small population benchmarks identified by
COSEWIC are similar for these 7 cyclic CUs, and were much less pronounced for the
other 17 CUs, regardless of SR model fitting results.

  The relative weight of evidence for Ricker-type models or Larkin-type models has been
explored in numerous publications (e.g. Walters & Staley 1987, Walters and Woodey
1992, Cass and Wood 1994, Ricker 1997, DFO 2006, Peterman and Dorner 2011 &
2012), but the number of stocks where Larkin-type models fit best depends on both the
length of time series and the model variations used. For example, Cass and Wood
(1994) identified 8 of 19 stocks as best described by a Larkin-type model, but a more

 7

recent analysis by Peterman and Dorner (2011 & 2012), which included the large returns
in the early 2000s, found that a non-stationary Larkin model fit best for 12 of 19 stocks ,

Finally, an absolute abundance metric and updated CU productivity (recruits per spawner)
trends was added to the data summaries. There are a number of Fraser Sockeye CUs that do
not have recruitment data and therefore, relative-abundance metrics could not be evaluated.
Since no absolute abundance metrics have been provided in the WSP status evaluation toolkit
(Holt et al. 2009), absolute abundance for all Fraser Sockeye CUs was presented in the data
summaries relative to COSEWIC Criterion D1 for small populations. Although productivity trends
were presented in the previous version of the data summary, high (>25 recruits/spawner)
productivity values were highlighted in figures (shaded grey) as potentially unrealistic and likely
artefacts of data issues.

2.5

CSAS WSP STATUS INTEGRATION WORKSHOP FORMAT

Status integration, using Fraser Sockeye CUs as case studies, was evaluated in a three-day
workshop that included the development of final statuses for each CU (which could include one
or more WSP status zones) and commentaries for the data used to assess status. In addition,
integration approaches were explored. Workshop participants included technical experts that
represented several specific stock assessment areas of expertise: Fraser Sockeye CUs, other
Pacific salmon CUs, fisheries management, and broader salmon research. Internal participants
and external university researchers were selected by organizers to encompass this broad range
of expertise. In addition, First Nations groups, non-governmental organizations (NGO’s), and
commercial and recreational fishing sectors were also contacted to solicit their
recommendations on technical participation.

Prior to the workshop, most participants received a pre-workshop interview to review the
meeting outline, the data summary layout (see preceding Data section) of one example case
study (unnamed CU), and to provide feedback to organizers. During registration, when
participants first arrived at the workshop, binders were provided to each participant containing
supporting information in a number of tabs: Tab 1: Workshop agenda; Tab 2: WSP general
background; Tab 3: WSP Strategy 1 technical background; Tab 4 COSEWIC Criteria; Tab 5:
workshop presentations; Tab 6: guide to CU Data Summaries. The subsequent three tabs were
left blank for three case study sets (comprised of CU standardized data summaries, and blank
templates to fill out as groups work through their CU-by-CU integrated status and commentary),
which were provided to each participant immediately prior to the start of each break-out session
(see Appendix 2 for data summaries provided for each CU):

  Case Study Set 1- Exploring Diversity: this set included six non-cyclic CUs that illustrate
the diversity of scenarios (i.e. conflicting messages from different metrics and differences in
data availability).

  Case Study Set 2 – Striving for Consistency: this set included 11 non-cyclic CUs broken

into two similar batches.

  Case Study Set 3– Making Sense of Cycles: this set included seven cyclic CUs that have
exhibited persistent four year patterns of abundance; for these cases a unique model form
was used to estimate abundance metric benchmarks.

Case Study Sets 1 & 2 included non-cyclic CUs that comprise the greatest number of Fraser
Sockeye CUs (17 out of 24) and are most similar to other Pacific salmon CUs; non-cyclic CUs
do not exhibit persistent four year patterns in abundance. In contrast, Case Study Set 3,
included the seven out of 24 Fraser Sockeye CUs that exhibit relatively unique four year cyclic
patterns in abundance (see end of section titled ‘Standardized CU Data Summaries’ for CUs

 8

identified as cyclic and rationale for this choice by the Workshop Organizing Committee). One
well known example of a cyclic CU is Late Shuswap (Adams River Sockeye), which exhibits one
large dominant cycle, followed by one smaller subdominant cycle and two weak cycles. Since
cyclic CUs presented particular status integration challenges in the previous internal DFO
workshop, due to their unique population dynamics and their use of specifically a unique
(Larkin) model form in relative-abundance-metric benchmark estimation, these cases were
placed at the end of the non-cyclic CU case study sets in the workshop schedule. This order
was implemented (i.e. completing all non-cyclic CU case studies, prior to the cyclic CUs) so that
groups could build their confidence in status integration while establishing their integration
approaches, and to maintain workshop momentum as each CU’s status integration was
sequentially completed.

Each workshop participant was assigned to one break-out group (four to six participants per
group) for the duration of the workshop. Each group was organized to include a diversity of
expertise that covered Fraser Sockeye stock assessment exerts, other Pacific salmon stock
assessment experts, external technical experts, and broader research scientist expertise. In
addition, at least one member of the DFO workshop organizing committee was assigned to
each group, to provide assistance to the group process, where required. Groups worked
through each case study set to develop both integrated single status designations (where
possible) and commentaries for each CU, and consistent integration approaches. Participants
were instructed to not spend time evaluating the details in the underlying information or data
presented, as this was previously reviewed in a separate CSAS process and results published
in Grant et al (2011). Case studies were evaluated ‘blind’, with generic labels rather than CU
names, to facilitate the development of a standardized WSP status integration approach which
would be broadly applicable to other CUs (see Discussion for more details on why ‘blind’
approaches were adopted for this process).

For each CU, groups first recorded their integrated status on one-page templates provided for
each CU (see Appendix E in DFO 2012 a). On these sheets they also indicated whether or not
these integrated statuses were either group consensus (i.e. each group member agreed with
their final integrated status) or were provisional (i.e. discrepancies amongst group members
regarding their integrated status or group members agreed to a single integrated status with
some provisions). In addition, groups also recorded the main factors (i.e. which particular metric
or supplemental information) that contributed to their integrated status, comments on their
group’s status integration process, and, in cases where the status was provisional, an
explanation of why. Groups also simultaneously recorded their integrated statuses on large
tables in poster format located at the front of the room, organized by CU (rows) and group
number (columns). Following each break-out group session, a plenary session with all 34
participants was conducted to record electronically, and in workshop minutes, individual group
integrated statuses for each CU in the case study set, commentaries, and integration
approaches, and to facilitate early discussions on across-group status integration and
commentaries.

On the final day of the workshop, integrated statuses for each CU, developed in the previous
day’s plenary sessions, were re-visited with the goal to narrow down groups’ individual
integrated statuses and, as a consequence, a CU’s status to a final single status zone where
possible. However, if single status determination was irreconcilable between groups for certain
CUs, the final integrated statuses could include the multiple status zones agreed to by the full
group at the final plenary session. Also on the final day of the workshop, CU names were
revealed to provide participants with the opportunity to introduce any specific supplementary
information relevant to a CUs WSP status that could be used to rationalize a change to the
integrated status or that could be added to the CU status commentaries.

 9

A number of workshop details were implemented to ensure workshop productivity and
efficiency. A detailed workshop agenda was provided to participants, which presented the timing
of case study break-out group and plenary sessions, and breaks (see Appendix B in DFO 2012
a). Given the work being conducted by participants was challenging and required sustained
efforts over a three day period, the agenda also included some quick presentations of optical
illusions and trivia questions (scores were kept for first group to answer the trivia correctly over
the three day workshop, and prizes were presented to the winning group on the last day of the
workshop). Groups selected unique names, from a suite of possible Latin species names, with
the subsequently revealed common names used for group identification in the workshop. For
each case study set, blank tables were displayed at the workshop in large poster format,
organized by CU (rows) and group number (columns). As groups completed their integrated
statuses for a CU, they were instructed to place a coloured sticky note (Pink representing the
Red status zone, Yellow representing the Amber status zone, and Green representing the
Green status zone) in the appropriate row and column, representing, respectively, the CU and
their group. The poster approach was used to demonstrate progress on CU status integration to
participants, during this long and demanding process, and also to facilitate early comparisons of
integrated statuses between groups. The workshop Chair ensured agenda timelines were
adhered to and, in conjunction with three meeting facilitators, led plenary sessions to develop
integrated statuses, status commentaries, and to record status integration decision rules. Group
integrated statuses recorded in poster-format, were photographed and later copied into an
electronic excel files. Final integrated statuses and commentaries agreed to by the full group
were recorded in an electronic summary table projected at the front of the room during the final
plenary sessions. A rapporteur was also assigned to the meeting to record a transcript of the
meeting proceedings.

Also to ensure workshop productivity, workshop organizers identified several important
communication pieces necessary to facilitate the workshop process. To remind participants of
specific elements required for the status integration process, select details were synthesized
from a number of publications (DFO 2005; Holtby & Ciruna 2007; Holt et al. 2009; Holt 2009;
Porszt 2009; Holt & Bradford 2011; Grant et al. 2011), and presented to participants using a
variety of communication tools: pre-workshop participant interviews, workshop posters,
presentations, and participant binders (see DFO 2012 a for details). A ‘Common Look Common
Feel’ approach was also adopted to assist with communication, which used consistent
templates for the presentation of background material across media. Specific communication
pieces were developed to include the following: background on the WSP (Goal and Strategies)
and, specifically, Strategy 1 (Standardized Monitoring of Wild Salmon Status); the definitions of
Red, Amber and Green WSP biological status zones; why status integration was required to
complete WSP Strategy 1, and how these integrated status results link to subsequent WSP
Strategies (particularly Strategy 4: Integrated Planning); the difference between biological
benchmarks (the focus of the workshop) versus management reference points (focus of
subsequent WSP Strategy 4 and related management processes); technical details regarding
the data summary lay-out and metrics selected in Grant et al. (2011); specific direction to
participants that the workshop purpose is not re-visit details in Grant et al. (2011), but to rather
focus on the status integration step; and description of comparisons of WSP status integration
work to similar biological status process both internal and external to DFO.

RESULTS

The Status Integration Workshop addressed both of its key objectives, as outlined in the Terms
of Reference (see Appendix A in DFO 2012 a).

The first objective was to provide integrated status evaluations that include identification of
relevant metric(s) used for the status determination for each of the 24 Fraser River sockeye
CUs. During the combination of break-out group and plenary sessions, final integrated statuses
were completed for 22 out of the 24 Fraser Sockeye CUs, including synthesis of the key pieces
of information used to designate status for each CU (Table 4 & Appendix 2). For two CUs
(Chilko-ES and Seton-L), participants were unable to assess status and the details are provided
in the status commentaries (Appendix 2). In additional detailed status integration results for
each group were also recorded.

The workshop also delivered on its second objective: to develop clearly documented guidelines
for combining information from different status metrics, using Fraser River sockeye CUs as test
cases. The results for this objective, however, differed from the original expectations of the
workshop organizers. Originally, the afternoon of the final day of the workshop was allotted to
draft a set of generally applicable decision rules (i.e. an algorithm for status integration) within a
full group plenary session. However, given the priority of the workshop was to complete
integrated statuses for each of the 24 Fraser Sockeye CUs, and this objective took longer than
planned during the workshop, half a day of the workshop was not specifically dedicated to
developing decision rules as planned. Instead, details on status integration approaches were
broadly recorded by each group throughout the workshop, both on individual group templates
and in full group plenary sessions (recorded in the workshop transcript and organizers notes).
This information was used to record consistencies amongst groups in their use of metrics and
additional information to develop integrated CU statuses.

Based on the in-depth discussions at the workshop, the case-by-case nuances in metrics used,
and associated commentaries on the underlying data, it is not likely that a single prescriptive
algorithm for status integration under the WSP can be developed. Rather, the CSAS workshop
produced a process framework for status integration (previous section) and detailed guidelines
for interpreting status-related information (See section on Status Integration Approaches
starting on p. 13).

3.1

GROUP-SPECIFIC RESULTS

Following break-out-group and plenary sessions, group results were recorded to capture the
range of perspectives on each CU’s final integrated status (Table 3; Appendix 2). Despite
differences in broad integration approaches between groups, there was consistency in the
considerations of metrics and supplemental information used to designate status (see section
on Status Integration Approaches on p.13). Specifically, 14 out of 24 CUs were assigned
identical statuses, and one CU was designated data deficient by all groups (Table 3). The
remaining nine CUs were designated different integrated statuses by individual groups,
although all groups collectively agreed on a single (Red, Amber or Green) or blended
(Red/Amber or Amber/Green) final integrated status for eight of these CUs (Table 4). Only one
CU (Seton-L) could not be reconciled into a single or blended integrated status. Generally CUs
that indicated a consistent status across metrics and supplemental information (for example,
Cultus-L and Harrison River-River-Type; see Appendix 2) resulted in the most consistent
integrated statuses amongst groups (Table 3). In contrast CUs that indicated contradictory
statuses across metrics and additional information (for example, Seton-L and Francois-Fraser-
S) (see Appendix 2) resulted in the most divergence amongst groups and individual group
members.

 11

3.2

FINAL INTEGRATED STATUS

In the final plenary discussions, participants reached broad agreement on integrated statuses
for 22 of the 24 CUs (Table 4). The 24 Fraser Sockeye CUs are ordered in Table 4 using their
final integrated statuses, with CUs designated Red (poorest status) located at the top of the
table to CUs designated Green (best status) at the bottom. Sixteen out of the 24 CUs were
reconciled between groups in the final plenary session to a single WSP status. There were six
CUs where final integrated statuses included two status zones. Both the Chilko-S and Lillooet-
Harrison integrated Green statuses were flagged as provisional by participants, given these
CUs have exhibited declining productivity and spawner abundance trends in recent years. The
Taseko-ES Red integrated status was also flagged as provisional, given spawner escapement
data for this CU are an index of abundance only and, therefore, this status designation was
considered more uncertain. The integrated status of Chilko-ES was designated data deficient,
as this CU does not have independent abundance data from the larger Chilko-S CU. Since the
Chilko-ES CU contributes less than 10% to the total Chilko-ES/Chilko-S aggregate abundance,
the aggregate status was assumed to represent the larger Chilko-S component. The integrated
status of Seton-L was undetermined since final statuses amongst groups were widely divergent
and remained unresolved through the final day’s plenary session.

Most groups questioned the relative-abundance-metric benchmarks used for cyclic CUs
(identified as cyclic in Table 4). Since this analytical issue could not be resolved at the
workshop, participants agreed to exclude these metrics for cyclic CU status evaluations during
the final day’s plenary session. The resulting integration approaches were similar to those
developed for non-cyclic CUs with no recruitment data, and therefore, no relative-abundance
metric benchmarks. Participants pointed out that this still left more information for status
assessments than what is available for many other Pacific Salmon CUs.

3.3

STATUS COMMENTARIES

In addition to providing final integrated statuses for each CU (which can comprise one to two
status zones) (Table 4), expert interpretation of the summary data used to integrate status was
recorded as status commentaries (Appendix 2). These commentaries provide the details
underlying the final decisions on status designations, which varied even amongst CUs with
identical integrated statuses. These details will be important when Strategy 1 (Standardized
Monitoring of Wild Salmon Statuses) results are linked to Strategy 4 (Integrated Strategic
Planning). Status zones alone do not provide an indication of which factors are driving their
designation, which would influence subsequent WSP steps (e.g. Table 1).

Status commentaries are presented in Appendix 2 (with the CU name identified) in the same
order workshop participants viewed the case studies during the workshop (from one to 24). This
order should assist participants in reconciling their group’s and personal notes with those
presented in Appendix 2. This CU order further provides the background on the sequence of
case studies presented to participants at the workshop. The information presented in these
commentaries are compiled from information recorded during the final day’s plenary sessions
both electronically in files projected at the front of the room, and also from the meeting
transcript. The data summaries and notes from individual group’s sheets were also used to
expand on this information, where appropriate. Following the commentaries for each CU are the
data summaries used by participants during the workshop to integrate CU status. These data
summaries, therefore, provide the foundation for the commentaries provided in the current
report.

3.4

STATUS INTEGRATION APPROACHES

Expert opinion on status integration and associated commentaries were elicited from
participants through a combination of smaller break-out group and full participant plenary
sessions. Each group was able to develop a consistent approach to integrate status information
across individual metrics and supplementary information for Fraser Sockeye CUs. The process
was likened to checking a patient for symptoms, starting with key vital signs (i.e. various
metrics), and then scanning for other signs of any underlying problems (i.e. supplemental
information). Not all groups completed evaluations of all 24 CUs, but each CU was evaluated by
several groups. While their broad approaches to integration differed, groups incorporated the
following considerations in some form:

1.  Relative-abundance WSP metrics (which compares the 2007-2010 total spawner

escapements to relative-abundance-metric benchmarks estimated across different
model forms and different probability levels representing, respectively, structural
uncertainty and stochastic, unexplained recruitment variation, uncertainty)

For non-cyclic CUs with recruitment data, one key piece of information relied upon by all
groups was the WSP relative-abundance metric. This metric often was a driver of
integrated status determinations, particularly if a CU’s relative-abundance-metric status
was consistent across all benchmarks (i.e. across all models and probability levels
presented) (Illustration A below). In these cases, absolute abundance was generally not
given a high weight. In contrast, if a CU’s relative-abundance metric included multiple
status zones (Illustration B below), then groups frequently used the status indicated by
the median (50%) probability level benchmarks, rationalized the selection of one
particular model form (based on the presence or absence of systematic productivity
trends in the Ricker ‘a’ productivity parameter), and relied more heavily on other metrics
and status-related information (including absolute abundance) to determine status. The
use of benchmarks and statuses across probability levels, and not simply focusing on
the median (50 percent probability level), represented a sensitivity analysis of status
described by the relative-abundance metric, which describes uncertainty in the model fit
to the data.

In cases where relative-abundance-metric statuses varied across model forms, CU
productivity trends were used to justify the selection of particular model forms. If a CU
exhibited systematic productivity trends (indicated by the figures in the data summaries
on time varying Ricker ‘a’ productivity parameter), then a model form that considers time-
varying productivity was selected (truncated-Ricker, smoothed-Ricker and recursive-
Bayesian Ricker model forms). If a CU exhibited no systematic productivity trends, then
a standard full time series Ricker model form was selected.

Relative-abundance-metric benchmarks were given a lower weight (or flagged in status
commentaries for further evaluation) if productivity figures indicated high outliers (> 20

 13

recruits/spawner) in the recruits-per-spawner time series, which may contribute to biased
low benchmarks and, therefore, optimistic statuses for this metric (note: although this
was assumed at the workshop, the effect of productivity outliers on relative-abundance
benchmarks remains untested, and further work is required to evaluate this assumption).
In addition, relative-abundance-metric benchmarks were compared to COSEWIC Criteria
D1 for small populations, and if close to benchmarks for these criteria (i.e. 250 & 1,000)
this metric was also flagged as potentially producing optimistic status evaluations for a
particular CU and given a lower weight in the integrated status.

2.  Short-Term Trends in Abundance WSP metric (which compares last three generation

trends in abundance to benchmarks)

This metric was generally considered in conjunction with other WSP metric results and
status-related information. First, given many Fraser Sockeye CUs went through a period
of high production (in many cases the highest abundances on their time series) in the
1990s, the recent trends in abundance reflect returns to average abundance for these
CUs. Therefore, in these cases, the short-term trend metric generally was not weighted
highly in status evaluations, given considerations of both the spawner abundance time
series and recent years’ absolute abundances.

Participants also felt that while this short-term (escapement) trend metric reflects the
current state of the CU (the response to all threats), these trends can be manipulated by
human intervention (changes to fishing mortality) and, therefore, may mask intrinsic
biological trends (such as survival rates). For this reason, participants typically relied on
a CU’s intrinsic productivity trends (Ricker ‘a’ productivity parameter values whenever
they were available, which removes density-dependence due to changing spawner
abundances from CU productivity) to indicate status more than short-term escapement
trends.

However, even if both short-term trends and productivity trends indicated poor status, if
both relative-abundance-metric statuses (across probability levels and model forms)
and/or absolute abundance information indicated a consistently higher status, then the
recent trend information was given a lower weight in status designations. In these cases,
however, participants frequently flagged recent trends in abundance and productivity as
something important to monitor closely, given the integrated status could deteriorate in
the near future if these trends persist. Conversely, if short-term trends and productivity
trends indicated a poor status and relative- or absolute-abundance metrics in recent
years were low, then all indicators together supported a lower status designation.

3.  Long-Term Trends in Abundance WSP metric (which compares last generation spawner

abundances to the long-term time series)

If relative-abundance WSP metric status information was available for a CU, the long-
term trend WSP metric was generally given almost no weight in status evaluations.
Statuses indicated by the long-term-trend metric were considered optimistic, given the
early time series is confounded by higher exploitation rates for Fraser Sockeye CUs,
which is a consideration when interpreting the status indicated by these metrics (see
Porszt et al. 2012). Similarly, the long-term metric is not informative for some CUs, such
as channel-operated systems (increased production after channels were initiated in the
1960’s/1970’s) and de novo CUs (new hatchery-origin CUs returning from an earlier
extirpated state), where the historical escapement time series does not reflect the
natural state of the system.

If relative-abundance-metric status information was not available for a CU, the long-term
metric was given some weight in status evaluations. In these cases, however, absolute

 14

abundance information was given a higher relative weight and linked to the WSP long-
term trend metric status. Given that statuses produced by the long-term trend WSP
metric were considered optimistic, this metric was more likely to influence status
evaluations if it indicated a lower status (Amber or Red), versus a good status (Green),
and was again linked to absolute abundance information.

4.  Absolute abundance metric (absent from Holt et al. 2009 as a recommended metric,

therefore COSEWIC Criteria D1 for small populations of <1,000 were used to identify CU
risk to extirpation on this metric)

Groups frequently relied on absolute abundance to evaluate a CU’s integrated status,
particularly when relative-abundance metrics were not available or, when available, if
statuses were inconsistent across probability levels and model forms. If one to four of a
non-cyclic CU’s recent years (2007 – 2010) total spawner escapements fell below the
COSEWIC Criteria D1, this would typically drive a lower integrated status designation
(Illustration C below). In contrast, if none of the four recent years fell below the
COSEWIC Criteria D1, then this would typically drive a higher integrated status
designation (Illustration D below). Either of these drivers of status designations would be
strengthened by whether or not any years on the entire time series fell below the
COSEWIC Criteria D1 designation.

Small Population Benchmarks (COSEWIC Criterion D1)

Small Population Benchmarks (COSEWIC Criterion D1)

For cyclic CUs, weak (low abundance) versus dominant (high abundance) cycles
influenced how absolute abundance information was interpreted. If a weak cycle year
specifically fell below COSEWIC Criteria D1 in recent years, this alone did not drive a
lower status designation if the dominant cycle year abundance was relatively high.

In cases where the recent trends in abundance metric indicated a Red status and recent
productivity trends were decreasing, high absolute abundances in recent years were
also used to justify a better integrated status.

Absolute abundance was also linked to the WSP long-term trend metric, particularly in
cases where the long-term trend metric was Green in status and absolute abundance
was high, both combined supported a higher WSP integrated status zone (i.e. Amber or
Green) even if recent trends and productivity indicated a lower status.

 15

Similarly, if absolute abundance was low (for some recent years falling below COSEWIC
Criteria D1), then even positive short-term trend statuses (Green or Amber) and recent
increases in abundances did not over-ride the poor status designated by absolute
abundance.

COSEWIC Criteria D1 was also used to evaluate relative-abundance-metric
benchmarks. If benchmarks were small, relative to these criteria, then the status
indicated by relative-abundance metrics was given a lower weight in status
considerations.

5.  Productivity Trends (presented in data summaries)

In cases where relative-abundance-metric statuses were inconsistent across model
forms and probability levels, systematically decreasing productivity trends (indicated by
the Ricker ‘a’ parameter value), were used to justify the selection of a time-varying
productivity model (truncated-Ricker, smoothed Ricker, and recursive-Bayesian Ricker
forms) to indicate status for this metric. In cases where relative-abundance metric
statuses were consistent across model forms and probability levels, this model selection
step was not conducted by participants.

Productivity information also was used to evaluate whether or not there were a number
of high outliers in the stock-recruitment time series (recruits/spawner > 20), which was
used by participants to flag relative-abundance-metric benchmarks and statuses and/or
assign a lower weight to these metrics in status evaluations. Relative-abundance-metric
benchmarks were given a lower weight (or flagged in status commentaries for further
evaluation) if productivity figures indicated high outliers (> 20 recruits/spawner) in the
recruits-per-spawner time series, which may contribute to biased low benchmarks and,
therefore, optimistic statuses for this metric (note: although the assumption that high
productivity years represent biased stock-recruitment data, and therefore, may affect
benchmarks remains untested, and further work is required to evaluate this assumption).

Productivity trends were also used in conjunction with recent productivity information
(productivity below replacement in recent years) and the WSP short-term trend metric. In
particular, this information may not change a high status designation for CUs with
consistently high relative-abundance metric and absolute abundance information,
however this information would flag a CU for further monitoring (such as Chilko-S and
Lillooet-Harrison-L). In contrast, for CUs without consistent statuses across relative-
abundance metrics or for CUs with not relative-abundance metrics, this information
combined would drive status designations.

6.  Fishing Mortality and Return Trends (presented in data summaries)

Fishing mortality and return trend figures, not included in the original data summaries for
each CU case study, were requested by participants on the first day of the workshop.
Participants felt that the estimation of the short-term and long-term trend metrics that
relied on spawner escapement data is confounded by fishing mortality in particular.

For the short-term trend metric, if both abundance (i.e. spawner escapement) and fishing
mortality was decreasing in recent years, this combination of trends was flagged for
particular CUs in their status commentaries. Specifically, if abundance is decreasing,
despite decreases in fisheries exploitation, then this would indicate the underlying
mechanism of these declines is likely linked to intrinsic productivity decreases. For this
reason, often productivity trends were considered more relevant in status evaluations,
since this information focuses on an intrinsic characteristic of the population.

 16

For the long-term trend metric, if fishing mortality was high early in the time series,
relative to the current period (as is the case for most Fraser Sockeye CUs), then the
influence of early high exploitation on the historical spawner escapement time series
would result in optimistic long-term trend metrics when compared to current year’s
escapements. For this reason, the long-term trend metric was frequently discounted in
status evaluations.

All groups struggled with interpreting the status information for cyclic CUs. The following specific
considerations for cyclic CUs emerged as a practical compromise, pending further analyses:

  The Larkin model was considered more appropriate than the Ricker model for describing
the spawner-recruit relationships of highly cyclic CUs. This was supported by analysts’
commentary on statistical measures of model fit. (Note: statistical model comparisons
were not available to participants). However, the key issue was whether or not the
relative-abundance-metric benchmarks using the Larkin model were estimated correctly,
which could not be resolved during the workshop. Therefore, relative-abundance metrics
were excluded from final status considerations for cyclic CUs. The resulting status
integration approaches were similar to those developed for non-cyclic CUs, where
relative-abundance-metric benchmark estimates were not available.

  Unique considerations for cyclic CUs, given the exclusion of relative-abundance

benchmarks, included considerations of trends in abundance and absolute abundances
across all four cycle lines together and also separately. For non-cyclic CUs, any single
year in the last four years falling below COSEWIC Criteria D1 often resulted in a lower
status designation, depending on indicators from other metrics and status-related
information. However, for cyclic CUs, if a single year falls below COSEWIC Criteria D1, if
this year is a weak cycle year and conversely, the dominant cycle year is quite large,
then this information was flagged but not weighted as much in status designations.
Similarly, if a declining trend is driven by a weak cycle, although flagged as a concern,
this trend was not weighted as much in status evaluations for cyclic CUs.

DISCUSSION

4.1

INTEGRATED STATUS OF FRASER SOCKEYE CUS

Integrated status designations and associated commentaries were developed for the 24 Fraser
Sockeye CUs, to address one of the two workshop objectives outlined in the Terms of
Reference: “provide integrated status evaluations that include identification of relevant metric(s)
used for the status determination for each of the 24 Fraser River Sockeye CUs”. Integrated
status designations for Fraser Sockeye CUs cover all three WSP status zones, ranging from
Red (poor) to Green (healthy) (Table 4). Although single integrated statuses were not developed
for all CUs, blended statuses (i.e. Red/Amber or Amber/Green) were still useful for relative CU
ranking. There were two CUs where status could not be determined, either because the CU was
data deficient, or because the CU had contradictory status information that could not be
resolved by workshop participants. Detailed status commentaries were also produced for each
of the 24 Fraser Sockeye CUs and are documented in Appendix 2. The combination of
integrated status designations and status commentaries is recommended for inputs into the
subsequent Strategy 4 on strategic planning (Table 1).

Integrated statuses for the seven CUs designated Red and four CUs designated Red/Amber,
represent the highest conservation concern of the 24 Fraser Sockeye CUs, and the highest
priority for future assessments. These CUs tend to be naturally small in terms of abundance

 17

(Cultus-L, Bowron-ES, Taseko-ES, Widgeon-River-Type, Nahatlach-ES, and Chilliwack-ES),
occupying a smaller geographic distribution, and/or were located higher up in the watershed
(Takla-Trembleur-EStu, Bowron-ES, Quesnel-S, Nadina-Francois-ES, Francois-Fraser-S,
Takla-Trembleur-Stuart-S), where adults returning to their natal systems to spawn have farther
to migrate (Figure 3). In order of decreasing conservation concern and assessment priority are
the four Amber, two Amber/Green, and five Green CUs (Table 4). In contrast to the Red and
Red/Amber designated CUs, these CUs tend to spawn lower in the watershed, both
immediately upstream of Hells Gate (Shuswap, Chilko, Anderson-Seton systems) and
downstream of Hells Gate (Harrison & Lillooet, and Pitt systems). The CUs in these systems
also tend to have generally larger abundances and/or broader spatial distribution compared to
CUs in the Red and Red/Amber designations (Figure 3).

Status designations for cyclic CUs were considered more uncertain than those for non-cyclic
CUs. This is attributed to the exclusion of relative-abundance metrics from evaluations due to
participants’ concern over the estimation of these benchmarks using the Larkin model, and the
appropriate methods to summarize recent abundance data to compare to benchmarks. Since
this analytical issue could not be resolved at the workshop, participants agreed to exclude
these metrics for cyclic CU status evaluations during the final day’s plenary session. The
resulting integration approaches were similar to those developed for non-cyclic CUs with no
recruitment data, and therefore, no relative-abundance metric benchmarks. Participants pointed
out that this still left more information for status assessments than what is available for many
other Pacific Salmon CUs.

Appropriate estimation of relative-abundance-metric benchmarks using time-varying model
forms was also debated by workshop participants. Further, a recent evaluation of Fraser
Sockeye productivity trends using an alternative model form (Larkin model), in addition to the
standard Ricker model, reports different productivity trends for particular CUs (Peterman &
Dorner 2012) from those presented at the workshop (based on Grant et al. 2011 results). For
one CU in particular (i.e. Quesnel-S, see Appendix 2 of Grant & Pestal 2012), Larkin model-
derived productivity trends could influence the final integrated status and commentary.

4.2

STATUS INTEGRATION PROCESS

Expert opinion on status integration and associated commentaries were solicited through a
combination of smaller break-out group and full participant plenary sessions. The advantage of
this approach was that it permitted independent small group evaluation of a range of integration
approaches and integrated statuses, which could then be consolidated in a series of plenary
sessions with all participants. Additionally, it provided the advantage of evaluating the
robustness of status determinations through comparisons of independent group results (6 in
total). Although the size of the integration process, with 34 participants in a three day workshop,
may not be feasible for covering all 450+ Pacific salmon CUs under the WSP, the general
approach of independent versus full group work could be replicated with a smaller number of
participants over a shorter period of time. Several key steps are recommended for subsequent
status integration processes:

1)

to ground the status integration process, the definitions of WSP status zones (Table
2; Figure 1), and the assessment actions and management drivers for CUs
designated in the different status zones (Table 1), need to be clearly articulated prior
to the start of these processes;

2)  production of standardized data summaries for each CU using previously reviewed

metric-specific status evaluations and associated data;

3)

‘blind’ status evaluations throughout most of the integration process to ensure a

 18

standardized approach to status evaluations across all Pacific Salmon CUs, which
focuses status integration on the consistently presented data summaries;

4)  pre-workshop interviews of participants to bring them up to speed on the material and
to also present possible barriers to integration success, which could then be resolved
prior to meeting;

5)

6)

revealing of CU names at the end of the process to add any relevant information to
the status determinations by the CU-specific experts;

independent evaluation of status by three or more individual (or three or more groups
of) stock assessment technical experts, representing varied backgrounds (including
individuals with biological expertise on different salmon species and CUs, and varied
specializations in conservation and stock assessment science); selection of technical
experts from both DFO and external groups such as academia, First Nations,
environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs), is recommended to provide a
broad diversity of technical perspectives for the integration process.

7)  as a final step, plenary synthesis of independent statuses and status commentaries;

Data summaries represented a critical step in status integration, by providing a tool for
standardization and efficiency in the integration process. Detailed information on CU biology or
CU-specific habitat and/or ecosystem threats were excluded from these data summaries (and,
therefore, from Fraser Sockeye CU status integration). Instead, this level of detail is required in
the subsequent WSP strategy on strategic planning (Strategy 4), where habitat (Strategy 2) and
ecosystem (Strategy 3) information is linked to Strategy 1’s status integration results and further
analytical assessments (Table 1). One important component to Fraser Sockeye status
assessments was the inclusion of uncertainty particularly in abundance metrics, which were
presented in the foundational publication (Grant et al. 2011) and also in the data summaries.
These included comparing both stochastic uncertainty (unexplained variability in recruitment)
and structural uncertainty (use of different model forms to describe population dynamics,
including forms that consider time varying productivity).

Although most participants agreed that ‘blind’ unnamed CUs was an appropriate approach for
the status integration process, there remained some concerns that important information was
being excluded using this approach. Organizers had debated the use of ‘blind’ versus named
CUs prior to the workshop, and concluded that ‘blind’ status integration was most appropriate
for a number of reasons. First, not naming CUs avoided inefficient side-tracks that might focus
discussions on very specific and detailed local habitat or biological information, and specific
threats to the CU, not relevant to WSP status integration process. In addition, the contribution of
this additional information would vary amongst CUs, and therefore, would result in statuses that
were not comparable between CUs; standardization of WSP assessments was an important
consideration for choosing to use unnamed CUs in the integration process. Finally, not naming
CUs was considered important to avoid any potential biases to status designations (linked to gut
feelings or fisheries implications), and instead, to focus participants on the current status-related
information used for WSP integration.

To alleviate some concerns regarding mostly ‘blind’ assessments, CU names were revealed as
a last step in the integration process, to provide participants with the opportunity to introduce
any specific supplementary information relevant to a CUs WSP status, which could be used to
rationalize a change to the integrated status or that could be added to the CU status
commentaries. Given this was the first WSP status integration process, less time was spent on
this step at the expense of ensuring participants focused on completing thorough status
assessments using the standardized data summaries for each CU. In the future, given

 19

efficiencies gained through experience in the current process, it is recommended that more time
be allotted to this final step at the end of the integration process.

4.3

INTEGRATION GUIDELINES

The second goal for the workshop was “to develop clearly documented guidelines for combining
information from different status metrics”. Details on status integration approaches were broadly
recorded for each group, and status commentaries developed in the plenary discussion capture
the key pieces of status information used by groups to designate statuses for each CU. Based
on the in-depth discussions at the workshop and the case-by-case nuances in metrics used and
associated commentaries on the underlying data, it is not likely that a single prescriptive
algorithm for status integration under the WSP can be developed. Rather, the CSAS workshop
produced a framework for future status integration processes (see previous section) and
detailed guidelines for interpreting status-related information (See section on Status Integration
Approaches).

While broad approaches to WSP status integration differed between groups, each group
incorporated a number of considerations consistently. First, for CUs with recruitment data, one
key piece of information relied upon by all groups was the WSP relative-abundance metric. This
metric generally was given a higher weight in status determinations if a CU’s abundance metric
status was consistent across all benchmarks (i.e. across all models and probability levels
presented). In contrast, if a CUs relative-abundance metric included multiple status zones, then
groups frequently used the status indicated by the median (50%) probability level benchmarks,
rationalized the selection of one particular model form, and relied more heavily on other metrics
to determine status. Other metrics included in the previously developed WSP toolkit used to
assess Fraser Sockeye status, including recent and long-term trends in abundance, did not
influence status determinations consistently, and their interpretation by groups relied heavily on
trends in CU productivity (recruits/spawner), abundance (spawners and returns), and fishing
mortality. Of note, metrics not included in the previously developed WSP toolkit, such as
absolute abundance (compared to COSEWIC criteria) and productivity trends, were important
considerations for final status determinations.

During the workshop, participants provided feedback on WSP status integration methods. Most
important was the recognition that no single metric alone, in the absence of the consideration of
additional metrics and supplemental biological information, drove the integrated status
designation. A recent evaluation of the reliability of specifically 20 different trends in abundance
metrics to indicate a population’s extirpation risk was conducted, which reported a continuum of
indicator performance (Porszt et al. 2012). In this study, although long-term trends in
abundance indicators generally performed better as a group than short-term trends in
abundance indicators, this difference was small (<10% difference) (Porszt et al. 2012). Given
the relative similarities in performance, it is important to evaluate and interpret the status results
from multiple metrics, in conjunction with supplemental data and information on a population.

At the workshop, careful interpretation of statuses indicated by short-term and long-term trend in
abundance metrics was recommended by participants. Since escapement data is used to
evaluate these metrics (mature individuals that will contribute to the next generation are
specifically used in these types of evaluations, which does not include individuals removed by
fisheries or en-route migration mortalities), exploitation and habitat alteration are factors that
can influence these escapement trends. For short-term trends, which is a metric used by
COSEWIC and IUCN to drive their status assessments, participants felt that while these trends
reflect the current state of the CU (the response to all threats), they do not necessarily indicate
intrinsic biological CU trends (such as survival rates). As a result, short-term trends can lag
intrinsic productivity trends, since reductions to fishing mortality can offset escapement trends in

 20

the short-term. Therefore, participants typically relied on a CU’s intrinsic productivity (Ricker ‘a’
productivity parameter values, which remove density-dependence due to changing spawner
abundances) trends to indicate status more than short-term trends.

Further to interpret short-term trend metrics, the retrospective statuses presented for WSP
metrics on the second page of the CU data summaries illustrate how this metric’s status
changes over the course of a time series. For example, Cultus-L and Widgeon-River Type
experienced a few periods in their later time series where the short-term trends in abundance
metric indicated a Green status, when other indicators and information indicate otherwise.
Conversely, there were a number of CUs (such as Chilko-S and others), where the short-term
trend metric indicated a Red status, when all other metrics indicated an Amber or Green status,
as these CUs were returning to average (relatively high) abundance following periods of
exceptional production in the 1990’s.  In these latter cases, trends were flagged as something
important to monitor, but when integrated with other metrics and escapement trend information,
these poor short-term trend statuses did not drive the integrated status designations.

The long-term trends in abundance metric may also not be as relevant for CU status evaluations
in cases where exploitation was high early in the time series, or human-induced habitat changes
altered spawning habitat between early and late periods of the time series (such as systems
where artificial spawning channels were constructed in the 1960’s/70’s). Since most Fraser
Sockeye CUs experienced high exploitation earlier in the time series, and therefore, lower
escapements than would have naturally occurred in the absence of fishing mortality, the long-
term trend metric was flagged as producing optimistic statuses (since it compares the current
generation escapements to this historical time series). As a result, this metric was typically not
given a high weight in status evaluations, unless it indicated a poorer status (Amber or Red).

Workshop participants debated whether status evaluation should reflect only the current status,
or anticipate future status based on current trends. For example, Chilko-S and Lillooet-Harrison-
L, were two CUs where almost all metrics indicated a Green status, yet recent trends in
abundance indicated a Red status. In these cases, the trend metric was not considered an
immediate concern given high absolute and relative abundances for these CUs, and also
because these CUs were returning to average following a period of exceptional production.
Therefore, although short-term trends did not influence the final integrated Green status for
these CUs, participants flagged these CUs as provisional due to these short-term trends. Since
Green statuses for CUs do not require detailed analytical assessments and management
response, participants felt it important to flag these CUs as provisional so that these decreasing
trends are not ignored in the near future. These considerations are also linked to how often
WSP statuses are evaluated.  If statuses are assessed every year versus every ten years, this
can affect how integrated statuses are designated, particularly in regards to which metrics
indicate the current state of the CU (abundance metrics and long-term trends) versus where the
CU is headed if current trends persist (productivity and short-term abundance trends).

CONCLUSIONS

This workshop on WSP status integration, which used Fraser Sockeye CUs as case studies,
represents the first integration process for Pacific Salmon. This integration step builds on the
considerable amount of work published in the years leading up to the workshop related to WSP
Strategy 1 (Holtby & Ciruna 2007; Holt et al. 2009; Holt 2009; Porszt 2009; Holt 2010; Grant et
al. 2011; Holt & Bradford 2011; Porszt et al. 2012). Status integration is expected to evolve,
given lessons learned through the current workshop, and subsequent processes. In the current
integration workshop, most of the Fraser Sockeye case studies represent data rich CUs (long
time series of stock-recruitment data) in the Pacific Region, which are largely unrepresentative

 21

of the mostly data poor Pacific Region CUs. Although there are some examples of data poor
Fraser Sockeye CUs, more examples from other species and areas are required to expand the
examples currently presented. For future groups of CUs, which represent different data
availabilities and metrics evaluated, future similar CSAS-supported workshops are
recommended to build upon the integration methods developed in the current workshop. Further
recommendations are provided below to assist with the implementation of future integration
processes. After a range of CUs has been evaluated in similar processes, it may be possible to
proceed with smaller expert-driven teams for status integration processes.

RECOMMENDATIONS

The WSP Status Integration workshop, presented in the current paper, was the first process
conducted to address WSP biological status integration. As a result, there were a number of
lessons learned and recommendations identified by participants that could be applied to future
WSP biological status integration processes generally, and also to future Fraser Sockeye CU
status integration processes specifically.

Generally applicable to all Pacific salmon WSP status integration processes are the
following recommendations:

1)  Further clarification on the frequency of WSP status assessments is required to ground
the status integration process; for example status assessments conducted every year,
versus every ten years, could influence status designations;

2)  It is recommended that data summaries, which were developed for the current workshop
by a technical team over a period of several months, should be consistent amongst
Pacific Salmon CUs and evolve as additional CUs are assessed;

3)  Short summaries for each CU should be added to each data summary, which includes

the history of the CU (such as systems with artificial channels), and other information
required specifically for interpretation of data summary information;

4)  the addition of an absolute abundance metric in the Holt et al. (2009) WSP toolkit of
metrics, and the development of associated benchmarks; in the absence of WSP
absolute-abundance benchmarks, the current integration process defaulted to using
COSEWIC Criteria D1 for small populations for this metric’s benchmarks;

5)  the addition of a productivity metric to the Holt et al. (2009) WSP status evaluation

toolkit; participants used the productivity trends in status evaluations broadly, given the
absence of WSP-defined lower and upper benchmarks;

6)  Increased clarity was requested regarding the difference between the Ricker ‘a’

parameter value CU productivity time series and the recruits per effective female
spawner time series, where the former removes density-dependent effects on
productivity and, therefore, should reflect differences in marine and freshwater survival,
rather than simply changes in spawner abundances;

7)  inclusion of fishing mortality and return trends in the data summaries was recommended

to assist with the interpretation of the long-term trends and short-term trend in
abundance WSP metrics;

8)  analytical evaluation of relative-abundance metrics based on carrying capacity data
(presented in Holt et al. 2009) is required to determine extirpation risk and recovery
potential, similar to evaluations conducted for relative-abundance metrics based on
stock-recruitment data (i.e. Holt 2009; Holt 2010; Holt & Bradford 2011);

 22

9)  provision of model diagnostics for each model used to estimate relative-abundance-

metric benchmarks; this would assist participants in evaluating the model forms most
appropriate for each CU;

10) although the individual WSP benchmarks that specifically correspond to particular
COSEWIC criteria include a buffer to the extirpation risk identified by COSEWIC,
clarification is required regarding how WSP benchmarks should provide an overall buffer
to ‘being considered at risk of extinction by COSEWIC’, where COSEWIC’s process to
determine overall extirpation risk relies on expert interpretation and integration across all
individual criteria;

11) further CSAS-supported workshops are recommended for Pacific Salmon CU status

integration processes, where the suite of metrics and supplementary information used to
designate status differs significantly from those explored for Fraser Sockeye CUs; this
would ensure consistency in process between species and different individuals
conducting assessments;

Specific to future Fraser Sockeye CU WSP status integration processes are the following
recommendations:

13) decisions regarding whether or not relative-abundance-metric benchmarks are required
for cyclic CUs must occur; currently, cyclic CUs represent a small fraction of all 450+
Pacific Salmon CUs, so trade-offs between investing further work in relative-abundance
metrics for these CUs (currently, despite months of work by an analytical
internal/external group, has not resolved analytical questions related to cyclic CUs),
versus using all remaining metric and supplementary information to assess status for
these CUs must be considered

14) if it is decided that relative-abundance metrics are required for cyclic CUs, then there are

a number of fundamental questions that present on-going challenges for these CUs: for
example, are we calculating these benchmarks correctly? Do Larkin-derived
benchmarks for cyclic CUs represent equivalent extirpation risk and recovery potential to
Ricker-derived benchmarks for non-cyclic CUs? Does the approach for evaluating
current abundance state (geometric mean) represent equivalent extirpation risk/recovery
potential for cyclic CUs?

15) additional work is required to estimate productivity trends for applicable CUs using the
Larkin model (rather than the Ricker model used at the workshop), which removes
density-dependent cycle-line interactions from the productivity trends; the workshop
proceeded using CSAS reviewed results presented in Grant et al. (2011), however, very
recent work by Peterman & Dorner (2011 & 2012) and Michielsens (Pacific Salmon
Commission, 2012, pers. comm.), indicate different productivity trends may occur if
Larkin model forms are used for particular CUs (Quesnel is one example where Larkin-
derived productivity trends do not show the same recent decreases as the Ricker-
derived productivity trends, which likely would influence the final status designation for
this CU); the model form used to evaluate productivity trends will be important to explore
further in light of this recent research, given the high weight assigned to productivity
trends in the status integration process;

16) at the workshop it was assumed that anomalously high productivity years (> 20 R/S)
may indicate biased recruitment data, and therefore, potentially biased relative-
abundance benchmarks; this assumption has not been tested, and therefore, further
evaluation of this is recommended;

17) future work on pulling out Chilko-ES specific escapement data is recommended, so that

 23

status can be assessed for this currently data deficient CU in the future.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

First and foremost, we acknowledge Marilyn Joyce, the workshop Chair, who rapidly oriented
herself to the complex issues of WSP Strategy 1 and Fraser Sockeye CUs from both the
process and technical perspective. Marilyn also brought notable enthusiasm and skill to the long
and demanding workshop process which, included with her unprecedented attention to
organizational details, was instrumental to the success of this first WSP status integration
process.

In addition, we gratefully acknowledge the considerable support provided to workshop planning
from individuals on the internal DFO organizing team (alphabetical order by last name): Mike
Bradford, Al Cass, Steve Cox-Rogers, Jeff Grout, Ann-Marie Huang, Jim Irvine, Les Jantz,
Marilyn Joyce, Marc Labelle, Wilf Luedke, Paul Ryall, Timber Whitehouse, Mark Saunders, Neil
Schubert, Arlene Tompkins, and Chris Wood. Each individual brought unique perspectives and
insight to the organizing committee, which greatly assisted with fleshing out the workshop
process and technical details. The success of the workshop is attributed to the time this group
of individuals dedicated to many workshop-related discussions and debates. Al Cass, in
particular, played both a key role in the organizing committee and was a key member of the
facilitation team at the workshop. In addition, we thank Carrie Holt who provided considerable
support on the early internal DFO workshop, and her foundational work on WSP metrics which
paved the way for the current workshop. We also thank the rapporteur, Bronwyn MacDonald for
her superb rapporteur abilities, as she skillfully recorded the discussions over the three day
workshop. We thank Mike Lapointe, Greg Taylor, and Jim Irvine who provided helpful
comments, which identified particular elements of the paper for clarification. Last, but certainly
not least, we thank the workshop’s participants who played a key role in both the synthesis of
status information for Fraser Sockeye CUs, and the development of status integration methods
for Pacific Salmon. Without their participation and dedication to the workshop process, no
workshop, would there be.

conservation units in the three status zones (DFO 2005: p. 17-19, 26, 32)

Status

Assessment Actions

Management Considerations

Red

“… a detailed analytical assessment
will normally be triggered to examine
impacts on the CU of fishing, habitat
degradation, and other human factors,
and evaluate restoration potential”,
“… detailed stock assessments will
identify the reasons for the change in
status”. “CUs in the Red zone … will
be identified as management priorities
… the protection and restoration of
these CUs will be primary drivers for
harvest, habitat, and enhancement
planning.”

Amber

“… a detailed analytical assessment
may be required to input into
Strategies 2 & 3..”

Green

“ a detailed analytical assessment of
its biological status will not usually be
needed”

“Biological considerations will be the
primary driver for the management of
CUs with Red status”. “The presence of
a CU in the Red zone will initiate
immediate consideration of ways to
protect the fish, increase their
abundance, and reduce the potential
risk of loss”.

“Decisions about the conservation of
CUs in the Amber zone will involve
broader considerations of biological,
social, and economic issues”. “involves
a comparison of the benefits from
restoring production versus the costs
arising from limitations imposed on the
use of other CUs to achieve that
restoration.” “implies caution in the
management of the CU”

“Social and economic considerations
will tend to be the primary drivers for
the management of CUs in the green
zone, though ecosystem or other non-
consumptive values could also be
considered”.

 27

Table 2: Three zones of biological status defined in the WSP (WSP p. 17 & 18)

Status

Definition

Red

“…  established  at  a  level  of  abundance  high  enough  to  ensure  there  is  a
substantial buffer between it and any level of abundance that could lead to a
CU being considered at risk of extinction by COSEWIC”

Amber

“While a CU in the Amber zone should be at low risk of loss, there will be a
degree of lost production. Still, this situation may result when CUs share risk
factors with other, more productive units”

Green

“identif[ies]  whether  harvests  are  greater  than  the  level  expected  to  provide
on  an  average  annual  basis,  the  maximum  annual  catch  for  a  CU,  given
existing conditions…there would not be a high probability of losing the CU”

Table 3: Summary of group results for integrated status evaluations. Status designations were labelled
provisional if a group did not reach consensus. The majority view is shown below, but the number of
groups with provisional status designations is also included. For example, ‘2 Red’ for Quesnel means that
two of the five groups that settled on a Red status had some dissenting views. By comparison, the ‘1’ in
the Amber column for Quesnel means that there was one group that reached a consensus designation of
Amber, which could not be reconciled with the results from the other five groups through plenary
discussion.

Section 1: Comparison to Abundance Benchmarks

Key Point: This metric compares the average abundance of the most recent generation to
estimates of the lower benchmark (Sgen) and upper benchmark (80% Smsy) for each CU.
WSP status is Red if the last generation abundance is below the lower benchmark, Green if it
is above the upper benchmark , and Amber if it is between the lower and upper benchmarks.

Key Challenge: How to integrate uncertainty in benchmarks (and resulting status
assessments) for each CU that includes 1) across alternative population dynamic models (rows
in benchmark tables); and 2) across probability levels that reflect uncertainty in the model fit to
the data (columns in benchmark tables).

Section 2: Trend Metrics

Key Point:  These metrics assess recent trends in abundance over the last three generations (up to
2010) and long-term trends (current generation average abundance relative to the long-term average
abundances).

Key Challenge: Interpreting both metrics together.

an estimate with poor accuracy due to
poor counting conditions, few surveys

An unbreached fence estimate with extremely high
accuracy given an almost complete census of counts.

an estimate of high reliability using mark recapture
methods, DIDSON methods, or near-complete fence
counts that have relatively high accuracy and
precision. Visual surveys that have been calibrated
with local fence programs;

Four or more visual inspections
with good visibility;

An estimate using two or more visual inspections
that occur during peak spawning where fish visibility
is reasonable; methodology and data quality varies
across the time series in terms of good to poor
quality;

 35

Section 4: Productivity patterns

Key Point:  Observed productivity (recruits / spawner) can show pronounced trends
over time.

Key Challenge: Should this information be considered in the evaluation of status, and if
so, how?

The points show standardized
deviations from the long-term
average ln(R/EFS), which is
independent of population
models. Years with positive
deviations had higher than
average productivity. The red
line shows an estimated pattern
in the productivity parameter for
a Ricker model.

Points show the raw estimates
of productivity over time, and
the red line shows a running
4yr average. Note the log
scale, such that each
horizontal line marks a 10-fold
increase. If R/ETS is less than
1, the population failed to
replace itself in that
generation. R/ETS larger than
about 20 are probably due to
biased estimates.

Key Point:  Show pattern in abundance over time compared to current estimates of abundance

Key Challenge: Considering uncertainty in BM estimates (i.e. across population models and
probability levels). Another challenge is considering how BM estimates may change, especially with
models that incorporate time-varying productivity.

Section 6: Retrospective Pattern in Status Metrics

Key Point:  All 3 metrics are designed to describe current status, but they differ in their sensitivity to
changing observations through time.

Key Challenge: Considering current metric statuses in the context of past patterns.

Same as the previous time series plot,
just on a natural scale rather than a log
scale. This emphasises the pattern in
large abundances.

APPENDIX 2: INTEGRATED STATUS COMMENTARIES AND DATA SUMMARIES

OVERVIEW

Status commentaries are presented in Appendix 2 (with the CU name identified) in the same
order workshop participants viewed the case studies during the workshop (from 1 to 24).

Commentaries are compiled from information recorded during the final day’s plenary sessions
both electronically in Excel and PowerPoint files projected at the front of the room, and also
from the workshop’s transcript. The data summaries and notes from individual group’s sheets
were also used to expand on this information, where appropriate. Following the commentaries
for each CU are the data summaries used by participants during the workshop to integrate CU
status. These data summaries, therefore, provide the foundation for the commentaries provided
in the current report.

CASE 1: FRANCOIS-FRASER-S (RED/AMBER)

(Management stock name: Stellako; Run-Timing Group: Summer)

Background: this CU rebuilt after both the 1913 Hells Gate landslide and a subsequent period (1964-
1968) of log driving that impacted spawning habitat (see Grant et al. 2011 for details).

Status Commentary

  although most participants agreed on a provisional Amber integrated status designation for this CU,

due to inconsistencies both within and amongst groups, this CU was designated a blended
Red/Amber status; one group agreed on a provisional Red (indicated by the small ‘r’) for their group’s
integrated status, although individual participant designations for this group included two Reds and
four Ambers; integrated status evaluation for this CU was complicated by its conflicting statuses
across metrics and information presented;





factors that indicated an Amber integrated status designation included the relatively high recent
absolute abundance (median effective total spawners was 88,000 in the last four years) and the
Green long-term trend status (although some groups felt long-term trends should be given lower
weight given the higher exploitation rates in earlier years); since abundances for this CU are returning
to average, following a previous period of above-average abundance, the Red short-term trend metric
for this CU was not weighted as highly;

factors that indicated a Red integrated status designation included recent declines in CU productivity
(with some years falling below replacement), and Red status for the relative-abundance metric for
benchmarks at the 50% median probability level using the recursive-Bayesian model form, which was
considered an important model form to use for CUs such as Francois-Fraser-S that have exhibited
recent declines in productivity; note that for most other model forms, relative-abundance metric status
was Amber at their 50% probability level benchmarks, therefore, model diagnostics might have
influenced the factors pointing to Red integrated status; in addition, the short-term term trend metric
was decreasing, although this metric was not given as much weight since this CU was returning from
high abundances;

Points of Discussion

  debate  regarding  whether  status  evaluation  should  reflect  only  the  current  CU  status,  or  anticipate
future  status  based  on  short-term  trends  in  abundance  and  productivity;  although  an  Amber/Red
integrated  status  was  agreed  to  by  participants,  if  the  currently  observed  decreasing  abundance
(short-term trend) and productivity persist, this CU could fall solely into a Red zone shortly;

  debate over the weight of absolute abundance (which was high for this CU) versus the weight of

status signals from other metrics and information (range: moderate to poor status);



the contrast between this CU designated Red/Amber due to conflicting metric statuses and additional
information, versus Cultus-L where all information points to a Red designation, highlights the range of
CUs that could occupy a Red status zone and the importance of the status commentaries in
subsequent WSP Strategic planning processes;

CASE 2: NORTH BARRIERE-ES DE NOVO (AMBER)

(Management stock name: Fennell; Run-Timing Group: Early Summer)

Background: the original population was extirpated by the construction of a downstream dam; after dam
removal and subsequent hatchery transplants, this population re-established as a new (de novo)
hatchery-origin (see Grant et al. 2011 for further details); only data post 1970, after this CU started to re-
build was used in status evaluations.

Status Commentary



the Amber integrated status was driven by consistently Amber (or better) relative-abundance metric
statuses across 29 of 30 paired upper and lower benchmark combinations (probability levels and
model forms); however, the lower benchmarks were flagged as being low (ranging from 300 to 3,000,
depending on model form and probability level) relative to the COSEWIC Criteria D1 values of 1,000
and 250 used to designate COSEWIC risk categories; very recent productivity appears to be stable or
increasing; although this CU’s short-term trends in abundance status is Red, this metric was given a
low weight given this CU is coming off a period of higher abundances; Green long-term trend status
(although some groups felt long-term trends should be given lower weight given the higher exploitation
rates in earlier years); one group agreed on a provisional Red (indicated by the small ‘r’) for their
group’s integrated status, although individual participant designations for this group included a
balance of Ambers and Reds;

  some concerns were flagged regarding the stock-recruitment data, given what was thought to be

unrealistically high productivities early in the time series (prior to 1980); as a result, there was some
concern regarding the use of this early data in relative-abundance benchmark estimation; this also
resulted in a lower concern over the apparent decreasing productivity trend for this CU, since if the
early suspect data were eliminated, the decreasing trend would not be nearly as pronounced;

  absolute spawner abundance was flagged as being relatively low and decreasing, with one year in the

past four below COSEWIC Criteria D1, which led one group to a Red designation

Points of Discussion

  discussion about the appropriate weight for the long-term trend metric (which was Green for this CU),

given this is a new hatchery-origin CU, so early abundances were negligible;

  data issues were flagged for data prior to 1980, where recruit to spawner ratios were greater than
20:1, which may account for part of the observed decreased trend in productivity; it was suspected
that issues with the data were linked to recruitment estimates, which would be particularly uncertain
during the early period of low abundances for this CU;

  discussion regarding relative importance of the WSP relative-abundance benchmark estimated for this

specific CU compared to the COSEWIC criterion D1. Some participants leaned towards a Red
designation for this CU, given this CUs absolute abundances were close to this criterion’s
benchmarks;

CASE 3: CHILLIWAK-ES (RED/AMBER)

(Management stock name: Misc.-Chilliwack Lake & Dolly Varden Creek; Early Summer)

Background: this system is relatively isolated and was only consistently assessed starting in the 1970’s,
therefore the escapement time series for this CU is relatively short.

Status Commentary









the differences in integrated status determination between groups, and therefore, to the final mixed
Red/Amber designation, was due to different interpretations of the same limited information for this CU
particularly related to whether or not this CU was cyclic;

the factors that indicated an Amber integrated status designation was the Amber status for the
abundance metric using the arithmetic average of recent abundances; in addition, this Amber
integrated status was also designated due to the high abundance (~40,000 total spawners) years, as
being well above the COSEWIC criterion D1 (assuming cyclic population dynamics)

the factor that indicated a Red integrated status designation, was the Red status for the abundance
metric using the geometric average of recent abundances; in addition, there are some recent years
where abundances fall close to the COSEWIC criterion D1, when comparing all recent escapement
data (assuming non-cyclic population dynamics)

there were considerable gaps in the information available to assess this CU’s integrated status;
specifically, the short escapement time series precluded the estimation of trend metric statuses, and
similarly, the absence of recruitment data precluded the estimation of abundance metric statuses uses
the standard methods or to plot stock productivity trends; therefore, the only data which were available
to evaluate this CUs status were very recent escapement data and benchmarks using the carrying
capacity information for this CU’s rearing lake;

Points of Discussion

  given this CU has exhibited considerable inter-annual variation in abundance, there was considerable
discussion on whether or not this CU is cyclic (which cannot be reconciled due to the short time series
available); status designations between groups was influenced by each group’s assumptions
regarding this CU’s population dynamics (cyclic versus non-cyclic); the cyclic versus non-cyclic debate
also influenced group’s interpretation of the very low (possibly weak) cycle years when high (possibly
dominant) cycle years are so abundant;

  discussion regarding whether CUs, such as this one, with limited data should be automatically

designated Red;

  since this CU is visually assessed, escapement estimates may be an underestimate;

  concerns were raised regarding the use of carrying capacity of the lake as a benchmark in abundance
metrics, since this metric has not been evaluated rigorously in simulation models compared to the
standard benchmarks used for CUs with recruitment data;

CASE 4: WIDGEON-RIVER TYPE (RED)

(Management stock name: Miscellaneous Non-Shuswap; Run-Timing Group: Late)

Background: this CU is a naturally small population, which occupies a small geographic area; this CU is a
river-type CU (migrate to the ocean after gravel emergence) that is adapted to tidal conditions of Widgeon
Slough; it is considered a very unique Fraser Sockeye population (see Grant et al. 2011 for further
details).

Status Commentary

  The Red integrated status was driven by both this CU’s low absolute abundance (falling below
COSEWIC D1 for a number of recent years) and the Red status for the long-term trend metric;
specifically, the current generational average abundance (89) is extremely small; this CU does not
have recruitment data, therefore, there are no relative-abundance metric statuses available;



the short-term trend metric, which indicates a Green status, and recent escapement trends, does
provide some encouraging indications of improving trends, however, these trends were not sufficient
to change this CU’s integrated status designation from Red; although the short-term trends in
abundance metric was Green in status, this metric was not given a high weight given this CU is re-
building from a previous period of record-low abundances;

Points of Discussion

  discussion on whether COSEWIC criterion D1 automatically over-rides WSP metrics statuses; for CUs
with no relative-abundance metric data, development of WSP-specific absolute abundance metrics
was recommended;

  questions regarding whether the recent increase in abundance was caused by increased productivity
for this CU or decreased exploitation rates, which would affect the interpretation of these increases;
since recruitment and exploitation rate data are not available for this CU, this cannot currently be
assessed;

  regardless of short-term trends, it was noted that this CU is triggering three COSEWIC criteria (small

abundance, small geographic area, and limited number of populations); this CU is naturally quite small
given its limited spawning habitat, therefore, it is likely that this CU will always trigger a poor status
designation, which cannot be altered by human intervention;

  additional information was requested for this CU including the following: 1. difference between
effective female spawners and viable female spawners; 2. exploitation rate pattern; 3. area of
occupancy; and 4. number of populations.

CASE 5: CHILKO-S (GREEN)

(Management stock name: Chilko; Run-Timing Group: Summer)

Background: this CU is amongst the least impacted by the Hells Gate landslide of upper Fraser Sockeye
populations; this lake was fertilized in 1988 and 1990-1993; although this CU is distinct from the Chilko-
ES CU (different run timing and spawning locations in the Chilko watershed), the data for this CU
currently has not been disaggregated from the smaller Chilko-ES CU; since the Chilko-ES abundance
comprises less than 10% of the combined Chilko-S & Chilko-ES aggregate, status information for the
aggregate is assumed to represent this larger Chilko-S CU (see Grant et al. 2011 for further details).

Status Commentary







the Green integrated status was driven by consistently Green relative-abundance metric statuses
across all benchmark probability levels and model forms; high data quality was noted for this CU;

the short-term trend metric (Red status) did not weigh heavily in status determination, since current
abundance indicated by both relative-abundance metric status and absolute abundance, was
respectively, Green in status and high (no abundances on the time series below 5,000 spawners);
further, this CU is returning to average, following a previous period of high abundance; in very recent
years, both abundance and productivity have increased;

this CU’s integrated Green status was flagged as provisional, given the potential for this Green status
to decreases to a poorer WSP status zone (Amber or Red) in the short-term, if these recent
productivity (recruits/spawner) and abundance trends persist; a few recent years of below
replacement productivity, although this could be linked to high spawner abundance (density-
dependence);



the Red short-term metric status does raise the importance of assessment frequency, since if this
decreasing abundance trend persists, then status on other metrics could change (to Amber or Red
WSP status zones);

Points of Discussion
  Workshop  participants  debated  whether  status  evaluation  should  reflect  only  the  current  status,  or
anticipate future status based on current trends. Most participants agreed that this CU is currently in
the green status zone, but short-term trend raises a flag to track it closely. Some participants argued
for an amber designation to emphasize the worrisome trend.

CASE 6: CHILKO-ES (DATA DEFICIENT)

(Management stock name: Chilko; Run-Timing Group: Summer)

Background: although this CU is distinct from the Chilko-S CU (different run timing and spawning
locations in the Chilko watershed), the data for this CU currently has not been disaggregated from the
larger Chilko-S CU; the Chilko-ES abundance comprises less than 10% of the combined Chilko-S &
Chilko-ES aggregate (see Grant et al. 2011 for further details).

Status Commentary



integrated status could not be evaluated for this CU given there are no independent data available for
this CU, separate from the Chilko-S/Chilko-ES aggregate which is comprised of ~90% of the Chilko-S
CU (see Points of Discussion below);

  participants recommended that an escapement index and proxy exploitation rate for this Chilko-ES CU

be developed to provide information for subsequent status evaluations;

Points of Discussion

  discussion about meaning of “data deficient” in this context, given that some survey data is available
and a time series or index of abundance could be constructed; once data is extracted for this CU
specifically, this CU may in fact have higher data quality than many other Pacific Salmon CUs;

CASE 7: HARRISON (U/S)-L

(Management stock name: Weaver; Run-Timing Group: Late)

Background: a channel started operations in 1965 to re-build production from the Weaver stock, and
subsequently allow for increased harvest opportunities on the Late Run CUs; the channel was also
constructed to protect this CU from periodic flooding events; Sockeye are preferentially diverted by
channel operators into the channel rather than the creek in this system; channel freshwater production is
higher than the adjacent creek (Weaver Creek) (see Grant et al. 2011 for further details).

Status Commentary







the Amber integrated status was driven by the mostly Amber abundance metric status across the
benchmark probability levels and model forms; although there are some Red statuses at 75% and
90% probability levels for certain models; the long-term trend metric was also Amber; one group
agreed on a provisional Amber status (indicated by the small ‘a’) for their group’s integrated status,
although individual participant designations for this group included two Reds and four Ambers due to
the Red statuses on the relative-abundance-metric benchmarks at higher probability levels for certain
model forms and the decreasing abundance trends;

frequent monitoring of the short-term trend (which is Red in status) was recommended, given it could
produce changes in other metric statuses, and therefore, integrated status, if this trend persists; this
metric was not weighted high given absolute abundance is currently high (generational average: 8,765
effective female spawners) with no years on the time series falling below COSEWIC Criteria D1 of
1,000.

this CU has not exhibited systematic trends in CU productivity, although the productivity estimates
may be biased high for certain years; biased high productivity may produce smaller lower
benchmarks, therefore, the abundance metric status could be optimistic (this is an assumption that
should be evaluated); in very recent years productivity has been low, but has remained above
replacement;

CASE 8: NADINA-FRANCOIS-ES MIXED CU (RED)

(Management stock name: Nadina; Run-Timing Group: Early Summer)

Background: due to channel construction in 1973, two separate pre-channel runs (with different run
timing and spawning locations) merged into this new mixed CU; abundance data used for metric status
evaluation only included post-channel years (post-1973) (see Grant et al. 2011 for further details).

Status Commentary



the Red integrated status was driven by consistently Red abundance metric status across 23 of 30
paired upper and lower benchmark combinations (probability levels and model forms); Red status for
all probability levels at or above the median (50%) probability level; in addition, this CU has exhibited
systematic decreases in productivity;

  although the short-term trend metric was also Red in status, this metric was not given a high weight in
status evaluations given this CU is returning from a period of high abundance (particularly the year
2000); similarly the Green long-term trend metric was not given a high weight, given the changes in
population structure from the early time series (spawning channel constructed in 1973);

  a few groups assigned this CU a provisional Red status (indicated by the small ‘r’) for their group’s
integrated status due to concerns regarding relative-abundance-metric benchmarks (see Points of
Discussion below);

Points of Discussion

  participants wanted to see more detailed model diagnostics for the Spawner-Recruit models that

underlie the estimates of abundance benchmarks, in order to determine which are most appropriate;
concern that lower abundance metric benchmark estimates are driven down by the large
escapements (and corresponding large productivity) particularly for the year 2000 (for this reason
groups wanted additional confirmation that this data point is accurate);



there is generally low contrast in escapements for this CU’s time series and groups were interested in
understanding why (was it due to exploitation rates or channel operations), since this may contribute
to the high range of stochastic uncertainty in the abundance metric benchmarks (across probability
levels);

  participants wanted more detail for prior assumptions about carrying capacity for this combination
channel (enhanced) and natural spawning system; groups felt the carrying capacity of this system
using photosynthetic rates (described in Grant et al. 2011) were a bit high and perhaps spawning
capacity carrying capacities would be more appropriate to use;

  Despite discussions about uncertainty in abundance benchmarks, all groups consistently

  selected a Red status for this CU;

CASE 9: HARRISON-RIVER TYPE (GREEN)

(Management stock name: Harrison; Run-Timing Group: Late)

Background: this is a river-type CU (migrates to the ocean shortly after gravel emergence); this CU has
increased in abundance and productivity significantly in recent years (unlike most other CUs which have
decreased in productivity); this CU also has a unique age structure to all other Fraser Sockeye CUs
(Harrison-River Type are three and four year old Sockeye).

Status Commentary



the Green integrated status was driven by consistently Green status for all relative-abundance metric
paired upper and lower benchmark combinations (probability levels and model forms) and across all
trends in abundance metrics; in addition, status for all other WSP metrics was Green and productivity
has been systematically increasing in recent years;

  since this CU has only recently dramatically increased in abundance, the stock-recruitment models

used in abundance metrics likely have a spawner capacity estimate that is biased low due to the low
number of high escapement data points in recent years; given some of the recent surveys during the
high abundance period were estimated with low precision visual surveys, short-term trends likely
underestimate the rate of increase;

CASE 10: TASEKO-ES (RED)

(Management stock name: Miscellaneous Early Summer; Run-Timing Group: Early Summer)

Background: this CU resides in a glacially influenced lake; escapement estimates are based on visual
survey estimates of carcasses in a lake, expanded based on survey effort, and, therefore, are likely
biased low and represent an index of spawning abundance only (see Grant et al. 2011 for further details).

Status Commentary


the  Red  integrated  status  was  driven  by  consistently  Red  status  for  all trends in abundance metrics
(short-term  and  long-term  trends);  this  CU  does  not  have  recruitment  data,  therefore,  relative-
abundance  metric  statuses  could  not  be  estimated;  since  abundance  data  for  this  CU  are  an  index
only, recent absolute abundances could not be compared to COSEWIC Criteria D1.



the  integrated  status  for  this  CU  was  flagged  as  provisional,  because  data  quality  is  rated  fair;
escapement data (which are an index of escapement only) require further evaluation;

Points of Discussion


initially, due to an omission in the data summaries, it was not clear to participants that the Taseko-ES
escapement  time  series  represented  indices  only  (as  opposed  to  absolute  abundance);  as  a  result,
early discussions centered on designating this CU Red in status given its absolute abundance triggers
COSEWIC listing based on its criteria D1 on small populations; however, during plenary discussions
when  the  escapement  data  for  this  CU  were  identified  to  participants  as  indices  only,  participants
concluded  that  since  absolute  abundance  data  are  not  available  for  this  CU,  this  CU  could  not  be
evaluated against COSEWIC criteria D1;



the participating assessment biologist who manages the Taseko escapement program indicated that
the short-term trend metric status is valid because escapement has been assessed using consistent
methods over time, but that escapements represent indices of abundance only (rather than absolute
abundance);

  given  the  escapement  data  are  indices  of  abundance  only, there was debate regarding whether the

current data rating of ‘fair’ should be downgraded to ‘poor’;

  some  participants  argued  that  the  escapement  index  time  series  should  place  this  CU  in  a  data
deficient status category; others argued that the limited data available should still provide the ability to
assess status;



it was recommended that escapement data (which are an index of escapement only) require further
evaluation to determine the reliability of the index, given lake visual surveys of carcasses are known to
produce poor estimates of escapement;

CASE 11: HARRISON (D/S)-L (GREEN)

(Management stock name: Miscellaneous non-Shuswap; Run-Timing Group: Late)

Background: this CU is comprised of several separate stream populations that migrate downstream to
rear in Harrison Lake during their freshwater fry stage; only a single population (Big Silver Creek) is used
for status assessments given it has been consistently assessed and has a relatively long time series of
escapement data (see Grant et al. 2011 for further details).

G G G G

Note: one out of the six groups did not complete a status evaluation for this CU; also one of the group’s
Green status was comprised of different status designations within this group (two Ambers and four
Greens), however, this group agreed to a group integrated status of Green in the final plenary session;

Status Commentary


the  Green  integrated  status  was  driven  by  consistently  Green  status  for  all  trends  in  abundance
metrics  (short-term  and  long-term);  this  CU  does  not  have  recruitment  data,  therefore,  relative-
abundance metric statuses could not be estimated;

  absolute abundance cannot be directly compared to COSEWIC Criteria for this CU since only one out
of a number of creeks is being used as an indicator of this CU’s status; however, for this single creek
alone (Big Silver), it does not trigger COSEWIC’s Criteria D1 in the last four years;

  although the short-term trends in abundance metric was Green in status, in very recent years there as

been a decrease in abundance and it was recommended that this trend be monitored, since if it
persists the status of this CU could change in the short-term (to Amber or Red);

  One group did not come to a consensus assessment, with two out of six group members leaning to
Amber status given the absence of abundance and productivity data to inform the status evaluations
and the very recent decreases in abundance which was assumed to coincide with decreasing
exploitation rates (however, changing exploitation rates could not be confirmed at the meeting given
this data does not exist for this CU); current escapement is also one third the peak abundance;

Points of Discussion

  Workshop participants debated whether status evaluation should reflect only the current status, or

anticipate future status based on current abundance trends; although a Green integrated status was
agreed to by participants, if the very recently observed decreasing abundance persists, this CU could
fall into a lower status zone shortly; this issue is linked to the frequency of status evaluations
assessments (if status is frequently assessed, then using the current status of the CU is appropriate, if
status is infrequently assessed, then some indication of where the CU is headed in terms of status
may be required);

Status Commentary

  the  Red  integrated  status  was  driven  by  consistently  Red  status  for  the  short-term    trends  in
abundance metric and some recent low years of abundance that fall below COSEWIC Criteria D1 on
small populations; in addition, the long-term trend state (0.54), although Amber in status, is very close
to the lower benchmarks (between the Amber and Red designation) for this metric (0.5);

Points of Discussion

  this CU has no recruitment data or carrying capacity data, therefore, relative-abundance-metric

benchmarks for this CU could not be generated;

Status Commentary

  the Amber integrated status was driven by the Amber status for relative-abundance metric paired

upper and lower benchmark combinations at the median probability levels (50%) for all models but the
recursive Bayesian Ricker model; however, since this CU does not exhibit any systematic productivity
trends, models that consider recent productivity (such as the recursive-Bayesian Ricker model) were
not given high weight in relative-abundance metric status evaluations;

  long-term trend metric Green status provides extra weight to the relative-abundance metric status

which were mostly Amber, with some Reds at higher probability levels;

  although short-term trend metric is Red in status, this metric was given a lower weight in status

integration evaluations given this CU is returning from a period of high abundance and also this CU
does not exhibit any systematic trends in productivity (unlike most CUs which have decreased in
productivity in recent years);

  diagnostics for recursive-Bayesian Ricker model were requested, given it results in a Red status for

the relative-abundance metric using this model at the 50% probability level, despite this CU having not
exhibited systematic declines in productivity;

Points of Discussion

  debate over stationary versus non-stationary stock-recruitment models used to estimate relative-

abundance-metric benchmarks; groups were confused by the different benchmarks and status results
between stationary and non-stationary model forms, as they thought these benchmarks should in fact
be similar, given this CU has not exhibited systematic decreases in productivity; diagnostics for all
models were requested for future status integration processes;

  the standardized residual trend removes the effect of spawner abundances, and therefore, this time
series was used by most groups to focus on stationary model forms given no systematic productivity
trends have been observed for this CU; however, other groups focused on the R/ETS recent declining
trends and focused on the non-stationary models;

CASE 14: CULTUS-L (RED)

(Management stock name: Cultus; Run-Timing Group: Late)

Background: this CU has been listed as ‘endangered’ by COSEWIC, and it has been hatchery enhanced
starting in the year 2000 as a conservation measure; the influence of the hatchery enhanced fish has
been removed from this status evaluation (stock-recruitment data for relative-abundance metric
benchmark estimates only includes data prior to 2000 and trends in abundance data does not include
hatchery marked Sockeye) (see Grant et al. 2011 for further details).

Note: one out of the six groups did not complete a status evaluation for this CU;

Status Commentary

  the Red integrated status was driven by consistently Red status for all relative-abundance metric

paired upper and lower benchmark combinations (probability levels and model forms) and across all
trends in abundance metrics (short-term and long-term trends); in addition, recent abundance falls
below COSEWIC Criteria D1 for small populations;

  productivity trends have also decreased for this CU in recent years;

Points of Discussion

  discussion about the sensitivity of the short-term trend metric to annual variability in abundance; in the
retrospective plot this CUs short-term status switched to Green twice despite the long-term persistent
decline in abundance; the recommendation was that short-term metrics need to be interpreted
cautiously when used for all CUs;

  debate over relative importance of WSP metrics and COSEWIC criteria; COSWIC Criteria D1 for small
populations was the main driver for one of the groups to designate this CU Red; alternatively, other
groups did not see the value in looking at COSEWIC criteria, given all WSP metrics clearly indicated a
consistent Red status for this CU;

CASE 15: LILLOOET-HARRISON-L (GREEN)

(Management stock name: Birkenhead; Run-Timing Group: Late)

consistently assessed and has a relatively long and complete time series (see Grant et al. 2011 for
further details).

G G g

G

Note: two out of the six groups did not complete a status evaluation for this CU;

Status Commentary
  the Green integrated status was driven by the absolute abundance for this CU, which was well above

COSEWIC Criteria D1 on small populations for the entire time series (of further note: not all
populations are included in the absolute abundance estimates for this CU, which include Birkenhead
River only, so absolute abundance for the CU is, in fact, higher than indicated by the data summary
results); in addition, short-term abundance trends are Green in status (and trend is increasing) and
long-term abundance trends are also Green in status;

  relative-abundance metric paired upper and lower benchmark combinations (probability levels and
model forms) have only in recent years changed to Amber status based on the retrospective status
time series for some model forms; current relative-abundance metric status ranges from Amber to
Green, depending on the model form used; participants expressed concerns regarding the
benchmarks estimated for this CU and requested further diagnostics to consider in their status
evaluations; therefore the Amber statuses for the relative-abundance metric at particular probability
levels and models, did not weigh as heavily in the integrated status determination;

  this CU was designated a provisional Green integrated status, given the declining productivity trends

observed for this CU, which should be tracked; in addition, further relative-abundance metric
diagnostics required for more thorough integrated status evaluations;

Points of Discussion

  debate over trend metrics vs. trends visible in time series plot; trends in abundance metrics were all

Green, however, very recent trends on the time series are decreasing;

  Workshop  participants  debated  whether  status  evaluation  should  reflect  only  the  current  status,  or
anticipate  future  status  based  on  current  abundance  and  productivity  trends.  Although  a  provisional
Green integrated status was agreed to participants, if the currently observed decreasing productivity
persist, this CU could fall into the Amber zone shortly;

  considerable  discussion  regarding  the  need  for  Ricker  parameter  values  and  further  diagnostics  to
cross-check the benchmarks for this CU; some concerns with high productivity years and whether or
not these values are correct, which may affect benchmark estimates;

Status Commentary

  the Red integrated status was driven by consistently Red status for all relative-abundance metric

paired upper and lower benchmark combinations (probability levels and model forms) and across all
trends in abundance metrics; in addition, this CU has exhibited very low recent absolute abundance,
with three of the four years below 2,500 effective total spawners and one year below 1,000, which are
the COSEWIC Criteria D1 for small populations;

  productivity trends have also been systematically decreasing for this CU;

Points of Discussion

  no discussion or debate on this CU’s Red integrated status, given the consistency in status across all

metrics and benchmarks;

CASE 17: PITT-ES (AMBER/GREEN)

(Management stock name: Pitt; Run-Timing Group: Early Summer)

Background: this CU is supplemented with hatchery produced fry releases (Pitt Sockeye origin); given
these hatchery-origin Sockeye are not marked, it is unclear how this supplementation influences the
stock-recruitment time series, which affects both the relative-abundance metric benchmark estimates and
productivity time series (see Grant et al. 2011 for further details).

G

Note: two out of the six groups did not complete a status evaluation for this CU;

Status Commentary

  the Amber/Green integrated status was linked to the mixed signals amongst metrics and status

information presented in the data summaries, and the different interpretations of these mixed status
signals between groups;

  the Amber integrated status designation was driven by the relative-abundance metric statuses, which

although Green at the 50% probability (median) benchmark for most models, are Amber at the
adjacent higher probability level (75%); in addition, this CU has exhibited systematic decreases in
productivity with some recent years of productivity falling below replacement; further the hatchery
influence could be confounding the productivity time series, making productivity appear better than it
actual is;

  The factors that indicated a Green integrated status were the relative-abundance metric and long-term
trend metric, which were generally Green in status at the 50% median probability level (for some the
consideration of adjacent probability level Amber statuses were not weighted as high); although the
recursive-Bayesian model did have an Amber status at the 50% probability level and this should be
evaluated in more detail (diagnostics and parameter values required); the short-term trend was not
given a high weight because this CU is returning to average abundances after a previous period of
high abundances (so assumed recent decreases in abundance were linked to density-dependent
factors); high absolute abundance (no years below 2,500 on the time series) with current average
effective female spawners of 15,877;

Points of Discussion

  debate regarding interpretation of short-term trend metric status, when CU is coming off a period of

high production (returning to average) and the recent trend metric is Red in status; debate regarding
whether or not the short-term trend metric should be given low weight in integrated status
determinations in these cases; there appears to be a trend in integrated status determination to
consider the consistency of the statuses amongst metrics, for CUs where most metric statuses are
Green, but productivity is decreasing, productivity alone does not change the status; however, in
cases of mixed status signals amongst metrics, productivity trends weigh more heavily into the status
integration designations;

  status category discussion: Amber designation used to monitor a CU if there are concerns regarding

where the CU is headed; versus flagging a Green CU in regards to concerning productivity trends; will
both have the same affect in regards to monitoring the CU?

CYCLIC CU-CASE 18: SETON-L DE NOVO (UNDETERMINED)

(Management stock name: Portage; Run-Timing Group: Late)

Background: the original population was extirpated by poor hatchery husbandry techniques and the Hells
Gate landslide; subsequently hatchery transplants were used to re-build this population; this population
re-established and labelled a de novo CU due to its hatchery origins (see Grant et al. 2011 for further
details).

Note: one out of the six groups did not complete a status evaluation for this CU;

Status Commentary

  cyclic CU’s: due to concerns regarding the appropriate estimation of relative-abundance metric
benchmarks for these CUs, relative-abundance metrics were not considered in final status
evaluations;

  no integrated status designation could be agreed upon by workshop participants; the integrated status
designated by groups included all three WSP status zones (Red, Amber, and Green); even within
groups, there was inconsistency in status determinations amongst individuals;

  two groups designated this CU Red based on the steep decline in abundance (-67%) and the Red

status for the short-term trends in abundance metric, and the decreasing productivity (one year below
replacement in recent years); in addition, one year (single sub-dominant cycle year) was below the
COSEWIC Criteria D1 for small populations abundance of 250;

  two groups designated this CU Green, emphasizing that the dominant cycle did not exhibit any

decreasing trend in abundance and has been quite stable since the 1980’s (after a period of rebuilding
in the previous decade after the original CU was extirpated); these groups discounted the short-term
and long-term trend metric in their status evaluations since they felt these metrics were strongly
influenced by a single low observation on a single subdominant cycle year;

  one group designated this CU Amber, as a middle ground to balance all the considerations presented
by the Red and Green designations described in previous bullets; although the group agreed to an
Amber integrated status, interpretations varied amongst individuals in this group;

Points of Discussion

  discussions on how to treat subdominant or weak cycles versus subdominant cycles in status

evaluations; if trends in abundance are stable for the dominant cycle that drives abundance for a
particular CU versus decreasing for weak (small) cycles, how do you evaluate these differences
during integrated status determinations; if a dominant cycle has large abundances, then genetic
exchange and spill over of other age classes from the dominant cycle occurs between cycle lines;

CYCLIC CU-CASE 19: ANDERSON-SETON-ES (AMBER)

(Management stock name: Gates; Run-Timing Group: Early Summer)

Background: forest harvesting and other human activities were believed to have deteriorated habitat
quality prior to the 1960’s, as a result, a channel was constructed between 1967-1968 compensate for
this loss to production; the channel accounts for a high proportion of this CU’s production; both the Gates
creek and channel are included in the escapement time series for status evaluations (see Grant et al.
2011 for further details).

Status Commentary

  cyclic CUs: due to concerns regarding the appropriate estimation of relative-abundance metric
benchmarks for these CUs, these metrics were not considered in final status evaluations;



the Amber integrated status was driven by the overall population increase since the 1960s and 1970s
(Green status for the long-term trend metric) and the stable abundance in recent years; combined with
the recent declining trend (Red status for the short-term trend metric) and relatively low abundance
weak cycle years; however, no recent years fall below the COSEWIC D1 Criteria;

  One group designated this CU Red in status; this determination was driven by the observed recent
decrease in abundance and productivity (one recent year exhibited below replacement productivity)
and the Red short-term trend metric status; also comments regarding concerns for the loss of the
dominant cycle year in recent cycles;

Points of Discussion
  No specific discussions on this CU;

CYCLIC CU-CASE 20: TAKLA-TREMBLEUR-ESTU (RED)

(Management stock name: Early Stuart; Run-Timing Group: Early Stuart)

Background: historical evidence suggests this CU has never been large; abundance was particularly low
from 1962-1968, peaked in the 1990s and has subsequently decreased; decreases in abundance are
largely attributed to this CU’s long migration route (greatest upstream migration of all Fraser Sockeye
CUs), their spring upstream migration timing, and the increased water temperatures in the Fraser during
their upstream migration (see Grant et al. 2011 for further details).

Status Commentary

  cyclic CU’s: due to concerns regarding the appropriate estimation of relative-abundance metric
benchmarks for these CUs, these metrics were not considered in final status evaluations;



the Red integrated status was driven by the short-term trend in abundance metric which was Red in
status and steep (58% decrease); declines have occurred in both dominant and weak cycles years;
abundance trends are supported by declining trends in productivity, which dropped below replacement
in a number of years after 1990; however, participants noted that spawner abundance did not fall
below the COSEWIC Criteria D1 in the last four to 12 years;

  CU increased in abundance from lows in the 1960’s, peaked in the 1990’s, and has subsequently
decreased in recent years; although long-term trends were Amber, they fell close to the lower
benchmark so did not alter the Red status designation;

Points of Discussion

  debate regarding the interpretation of the two alternative productivity time series (Ricker residuals

versus R/ETS);

CYCLIC CU-CASE 21: QUESNEL-S (RED)

(Management stock name: Quesnel; Run-Timing Group: Summer)

Background: this CU was likely the largest of all Summer Run timed populations prior to the late-1880’s;
subsequently, this CU declined due to dam construction at the outlet of Quesnel Lake, placer mining
impacts on spawning habitat, and the Hells Gate landslide; after barriers to fish migration were
eliminated, this CU started to re-build notably in the 1980’s (see Grant et al. 2011 for further details).

Status Commentary

  cyclic CUs: due to concerns regarding the appropriate estimation of relative-abundance metric
benchmarks for these CUs, these metrics were not considered in final status evaluations;



the Red integrated status was driven by productivity, which decreased strongly with a number of years
falling below replacement; the short-term trend metric was Red and indicated a steep decline (-92%)
also influenced status, however, it was also noted that this CU was returning to average abundances
after a period of high abundance (*however, see Points of Discussion on productivity trends);

  one group designated this CU Amber due to the large absolute abundance (current average effective
female spawners: 39,952) and concerns regarding the productivity trends estimated using Ricker
model residuals, which may not be capturing the effects of delay density on the productivity trends
(Larkin model may be more appropriate); therefore, if using a more appropriate model for cyclic CUs,
this CU may not exhibit systematic decreases in productivity (see Peterman & Dorner 2012);



long-term trend metric (Green status) was not weighted in the status evaluations, given this CU’s early
time series was low after a period of human activities that significantly reduced this population’s size;
therefore, the long-term time series does not provide appropriate comparison for the long-term trend
metric;

Points of Discussion

  lots of discussion on this CU, particularly after this CU was revealed to be Quesnel-S CU; lots of

concern interpreting productivity trends for this CU using Ricker residuals given this is a cyclic CU with
delay-density interactions, therefore, a Larkin model may more appropriately reflect trends in
productivity and, if the Larkin model were used, the productivity trend may not be decreasing for this
CU and this was one of the key drivers of the Red status designation;

  some participants felt more information on the effects of the high abundance years on population

dynamics is required to evaluate the status of this CU effectively; as abundance started to increase on
the subdominant cycles, in addition to the dominant cycles, had an effect on productivity and
subsequent abundances; some participants indicated that this increase in abundance on dominant
and subdominant cycles in the 1990s was caused by decreased exploitation;

CYCLIC CU-CASE 22: SHUSWAP-COMPLEX-L (GREEN)

(Management stock name: Late Shuswap; Run-Timing Group: Late)

Background: This CU comprises a large proportion of total Fraser Sockeye return abundances when this
CU is on its dominant cycle; in contrast the subdominant and weak cycles of this CU have relatively small
abundances (see Grant et al. 2011 for further details).

Status Commentary

  cyclic CUs: due to concerns regarding the appropriate estimation of relative-abundance metric
benchmarks for these CUs, these metrics were not considered in final status evaluations;

  the Green integrated status was driven by the recent increasing trend in abundance (Green status and

46% increase); the absence of systematic trends in productivity (stable productivity); and a large
number of spawners on the dominant cycle year for this CU (the dominant cycle abundance in the last
generation was 5.5 million);

  Red status designation by one group was attributed to a few years of below replacement productivity
in recent years and a recent decrease in productivity on the R/ETS time series; in addition, one weak
cycle year was particularly low in 2009 (164 effective total spawners), falling below the COSEWIC
Criteria D1 of 250;

Points of Discussion

  debate regarding the implications of highly cyclic abundance patterns for risk of extirpation; if there is
one high-abundance dominant cycle that is consistently stable in terms of productivity and trends and
three very small cycles, does this uneven distribution of generational abundance, with most of the
genetic information and biomass concentrated in a single dominant year (out of four) increase the
CU’s risk of extirpation?

CYCLIC CU-CASE 23: SHUSWAP-ES (AMBER/GREEN)

(Management stock name: Scotch & Seymour; Run-Timing Group: Early Summer)

Background: the Scotch Creek time series was enhanced on the cycle line coinciding with the Adams
River dominant cycle, using Seymour Creek as a donor stock; as a result the Scotch Creek population
started to build in the 1980’s; Seymour is frequently used a hatchery donor population (see Grant et al.
2011 for further details).

Status Commentary

  cyclic CUs: due to concerns regarding the appropriate estimation of relative-abundance metric
benchmarks for these CUs, these metrics were not considered in final status evaluations;

  the Green integrated status was driven by the large and building abundances on the dominant cycle

(Green long-term trends metric) and increasing productivity in recent years;

  the Amber integrated status included the Green integrated status considerations described in the

previous bullet, but also included concerns over short-term trend in abundance metric (Red and 34%
decrease), one very recent observation of low abundance on a weak cycle that falls below the
COSEWIC Criteria D1 of 1,000, and recent decreases in abundance in the off-cycle years; however,
most of this decreasing trend was attributed to a single weak cycle year in 2009, therefore, this
decreasing trend along was not sufficient to place this CU in a Red status zone;

Points of Discussion

  discussion regarding how to interpret trends on the dominant versus subdominant cycle; one

participant suggested that the dominant cycle’s trends is key, given it contributes most to a cyclic CUs
abundance and that instead of tracking subdominant cycle trends, a lower threshold of abundance
was recommended (such as no single cycle year falling below 1,000?); another participant suggested
that abundance trends on the weak cycle years should not be ignored;

CYCLIC CU-CASE 24: TAKLA-TREMBLEUR-STUART-S (RED/AMBER)

(Management stock name: Late Stuart; Run-Timing Group: Summer)

Background: historically human activities impacted spawning habitat, which has subsequently improved
in Middle River; Tachie had log driving activity historically, although the impact of this on spawning habitat
is unknown (see Grant et al. 2011 for further details).

Status Commentary

  cyclic CUs: due to concerns regarding the appropriate estimation of relative-abundance metric
benchmarks for these CUs, these metrics were not considered in final status evaluations;

  the integrated Amber status was selected due to the combination of large absolute abundance (no
recent abundances near the COSEWIC Criteria D1 for small populations), and the Green long-term
trend metric and red short-term trend metric (however, this CU is returning to average following a
period of high abundance);



the integrated Red status was driven by the decreasing productivity (including a few recent years of
below replacement productivity); also influenced by declining trends in abundance (which were large
at -85%), although it was noted that this CU is coming off a period of high abundance, the steepness
of the recent decrease in abundance is a concern;
