M E S S AG E   F RO M  T H E   M I N I S T E R

As Canada’s Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, it is my pleasure to present
Canada’s Policy for Conservation of Wild Pacific Salmon.

This  policy  represents  the  culmination  of  five  years  of  consultations  with
Canadians concerned about the protection of Pacific salmon. It will usher in
a  significant  new  approach  to  the  conservation  of  one  of  Canada’s  most
valuable  and  cherished  resources  –  wild  Pacific  salmon.  Its  adoption
represents Fisheries and Oceans Canada’s commitment to maintain healthy
and diverse populations of salmon that will support sustainable fisheries now,
and meet the needs of future generations.

This new approach specifies clear objectives, establishes strategies to meet them, and presents a decision-making
process  to  ensure  that  choices  made  about  salmon  conservation  reflect  societal  values.  The  policy  places
conservation of salmon and their habitats as the first priority for resource management.

It gives tangible effect to this principle by committing to safeguard the genetic diversity of wild salmon, and
maintain  habitat  and  ecosystem  integrity. The  policy  also  considers  the  values  that  the  harvesting  of  Pacific
salmon provide to people.  It reflects a management framework that will provide care and respect for the resource
and its ecosystem, and for the people who rely on it for food and spiritual needs, for recreation, and for their
livelihood.

I  would  like  to  thank  the  hundreds  of  dedicated  Canadians  who  participated  in  our  consultations  and
contributed to the completion of this policy. Their expertise, their dedication, and their passionate advocacy for
the well-being of this precious resource have been of immeasurable value and have helped us to improve the
policy as it was being developed.

While the adoption of this policy is a significant step, the work to secure the future of Pacific salmon is just
beginning.  My Department is fully committed to its implementation, but we know that full success in meeting
its  objectives  will  depend  upon  cooperation  among  all  who  have  an  interest  in  wild  Pacific  salmon.  I  am
confident that with the sustained efforts of First Nations, fishers, environmental groups, and members of the
public, we will together be able to make real and lasting change.

I look forward to working with all groups to implement this policy and secure a brighter future for salmon.

Minister of Fisheries and Oceans

Wild Salmon Policy

The Wild Salmon Policy – A Snapshot

The goal of the Wild Salmon Policy is to restore and maintain healthy and diverse salmon
populations and their habitats for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity.

This policy goal will be advanced by safeguarding the genetic diversity of wild salmon populations,
maintaining habitat and ecosystem integrity, and managing fisheries for sustainable benefits.

Conservation of wild salmon and their habitat is the highest priority for resource management
decision-making.

Resource management processes and decisions will honour Canada’s obligations to First Nations.

Implementation of this policy will involve an open and inclusive process aimed at making decisions
about salmon stewardship that consider social, economic, and biological consequences. People
throughout British Columbia and the Yukon will contribute to decisions that reflect society’s values
for wild salmon.

Wild salmon will be maintained by identifying and managing "Conservation Units" (CUs) that
reflect their geographic and genetic diversity. A CU is a group of wild salmon sufficiently isolated
from other groups that, if lost, is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable
timeframe (e.g., a human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations).

The status of CUs will be monitored, assessed against selected benchmarks, and reported publicly.
Where monitoring indicates low levels of abundance, or deterioration in the distribution of the
spawning components of a CU, a full range of management actions to reverse declines – including
habitat, enhancement, and harvest measures – will be considered and an appropriate response
implemented.

Measures for habitat protection and salmon enhancement will focus on sustaining wild salmon. An
integrated approach to habitat management – involving assessment of habitat condition,
identification of indicators and benchmarks, and monitoring of status – will be adopted that links
fish production with watershed and coastal planning and stewardship initiatives.

Ecosystem considerations will be incorporated into salmon management. Indicators will be
developed to assess the status of freshwater ecosystems. Information from ocean climate studies
of marine survival and of the biological condition of salmon will be integrated into the annual
assessments of salmon abundance that guide salmon harvest planning.

The policy aims to maintain CUs but recognizes there will be exceptional circumstances where it
is not feasible or reasonable to fully address all risks.  Where an assessment concludes that
conservation measures will be ineffective or the social or economic costs to rebuild a CU are
extreme, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans may decide to limit the range of measures taken.
Such a decision will be made openly and transparently.

This policy will foster a healthy, diverse, and abundant salmon resource for future generations of
Canadians. It will support sustainable fisheries to meet the needs of First Nations and contribute
to the current and future prosperity of Canadians.

What are Wild Pacific Salmon?

The Wild Salmon Policy (WSP)
addresses five species of Pacific
salmon found in British Columbia and
the Yukon2 Oncorhynchus nerka
(sockeye), O. kisutch (coho), O.
tshawytscha (chinook), O. gorbuscha
(pink), and O. keta (chum).These
species form part of the larger
classification of Pacific salmonids,
which include steelhead and cutthroat
trout. DFO has authority under the
federal Fisheries Act to manage Pacific
salmon and their habitat.The
management of steelhead and
cutthroat trout has been delegated to
the Province of British Columbia,
though responsibility for protection of
their habitat remains with the
Department.The Department will co-
operate with BC in the management
and enhancement of these species,
consistent with the WSP.

Salmon are considered “wild” if
they have spent their entire life cycle
in the wild and originate from parents
that were also produced by natural
spawning and continuously lived in the
wild.

Salmon that originate directly

from hatcheries and managed
spawning channels are not considered
wild in this policy, and are called
“enhanced” salmon.

This term is sometimes also
applied to salmon that originate from
other enhancement activities, such as
habitat restoration and lake enrichment,
since their rate of production has
been augmented. However, the
reproduction of these fish has not
been altered, and therefore they are
deemed “wild” in this policy.

The requirement in the definition

that a wild salmon must complete
more than one full generation in the
wild safeguards against potential
adverse effects resulting from artificial
culture.

2Wild Pacific salmon in the Northwest
Territories are relatively uncommon, not
actively managed, and are not included in
this policy.

I N T R O D U C T I O N

Canadians on the West Coast have an enduring connection with Pacific
salmon forged thousands of years ago with the arrival of the first peoples.
Wild salmon serve as a vital source of food for First Nations and have a
central place in their culture and spirituality; they provide jobs, income,
and enjoyment for individuals, businesses, and coastal communities; and
they play a key role in natural ecosystems, nourishing a complex web of
interconnected  species.  The  ties  of  Pacific  salmon  with  west  coast
communities, people, and ecology have been eloquently described in the
writings of the late Roderick Haig-Brown, who observed:

The salmon runs are a visible symbol of life, death and regeneration,
plain for all to see and share ... The salmon are a test of a healthy environment,
a lesson in environmental needs. Their abundant presence on the spawning beds
is a lesson of hope, of deep importance for the future of man.1

During  the  past  decade,  the  management  of  Pacific  salmon  has
become progressively more challenging for various reasons. Supreme Court
decisions, varying ocean productivity, conservation concerns, habitat loss,
international  agreements,  new  Canadian  legislation  governing  species  at
risk,  shifts  in  global  markets,  and  altered  public  expectations  have  all
contributed  to  this  dynamic  operating  context.  The  Department  of
Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) has adapted to changing circumstances but
policy  and  programs  must  continue  to  be  reshaped  to  address
contemporary challenges and secure a healthy future for Canada’s Pacific
salmon. This document provides a blueprint for meeting these challenges  –
it presents Canada’s policy for conservation of wild Pacific salmon.

Section  91  of  the  Constitution  Act,  1867  assigns
exclusive  legislative  authority  over  “Sea  Coast  and
Inland  Fisheries”  to  the  federal  government.  The
Minister  of  Fisheries  and  Oceans  exercises  this
authority  under  the  Fisheries  Act and  regulations.

and
accountability for the protection and sustainable use
of  fisheries  resources  and  their  habitat.  The
Minister’s  authority  includes  the  discretion  and
powers necessary to regulate access to the resource,
impose  conditions  on  harvesting,  and  enforce
regulations.  Provincial,  Territorial  and  municipal
governments  have  important  authorities  with
respect to land, water and waste disposal that need to
complement efforts to conserve fish and fish habitat.

The  legal  context  for  management  of  wild
salmon is also defined by court decisions respecting
Aboriginal  and  treaty  rights.  Existing  Aboriginal
and  treaty  rights  are  recognized  and  affirmed  in
section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.  In its 1990
decision  in  R.  v.  Sparrow,  the  Supreme  Court  of
Canada held that the recognition and affirmation of
existing  Aboriginal  rights  in  the  Constitution  Act,
1982  means  that  any  infringement  of  such  rights
must  be  justified.  As  described  in  more  detail  in
Appendix  1,  DFO  seeks  to  manage  fisheries  in  a
manner consistent with the decision of the Supreme
Court of Canada in R. v. Sparrow and subsequent
court  decisions  such  as  the  decision  of  the  BC
Court  of  Appeal  in  R.  v.  Jack,  John  and  John.

In  its  2004  decision  in  Haida  v.  BC,  the
Supreme  Court  of  Canada  concluded  that  the
Crown has a legal duty to consult with Aboriginal
groups and, depending on the strength of the claim
of  Aboriginal  rights  or  Aboriginal  title  and  the
seriousness  of  the  potential  adverse  effect  of  a
decision  on
title,
accommodate their interests when the Crown has
knowledge  of  the  potential  existence  of  an
Aboriginal right or Aboriginal title and is making
decisions that might adversely affect the Aboriginal
right or Aboriginal title.  The Court also concluded
that the scope of the duty will vary depending on
the circumstances.

The WSP will be implemented in accordance
with  the  guidance  provided  by  the  courts  with
respect  to  governments’  obligations  to  First
Nations,  including  the  guidance  provided  by  the
Supreme Court of Canada in Haida v. BC, and any
guidance from courts in future. The WSP will also
be  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  Nisga’a
Final Agreement, the Yukon Final Agreements, and
any  other  treaties  or  agreements  entered  into
between the federal government and First Nations.

The health of Pacific salmon depends not only on
their  abundance  but  also  on  their  biological
diversity.  That  diversity  includes  the  irreplaceable
lineages  of  salmon  evolved  through  time,  the
geographic  distribution  of  these  populations,  the
genetic  differences  and  life  history  variations
observed  among  them,  and  the  habitats  that
support  these  differences.  Diversity  of  Pacific
salmon  represents  their  legacy  to-date  and  their
potential  for  adaptation  to  future  changes  in
climate, fishing, and habitat. Protecting diversity is
the most prudent policy for the future continuance
of wild salmon as well as  the ecological processes
that  depend  on  them  and  the  cultural, social,  and
economic benefits drawn from them.

Wild Salmon Policy

Concern  for  diversity  in  Pacific  salmon
emerged  as  a  significant  issue  during  the  1990s,
along  with  Canada’s  support  for  the  1992  UN
Convention  on  Biological  Diversity.  By  1990  in
southwestern  BC,  one-third  of  the  spawning
locations  (a  species  in  a  stream)  known  since  the
1950s  had  been  lost  or  diminished  to  such  low
numbers  that  spawners  were  not  consistently
monitored  at  these  sites.3 This  portion  of  BC  is
however the centre of urbanization and development
and is not representative of the province as a whole.
In 1996, a study for the American Fisheries Society
identified  8,171  natural  spawning
locations
throughout BC and the Yukon.4 The study reported
that  salmon  had  been  extirpated  in  2  per  cent  of
these locations and had a high chance of extinction
in  another  12  per  cent,  based  on  the  current
numbers of spawners and/or the rate of change in
those numbers. These declines in diversity are one
impetus  for  a  new  management  approach  for  wild
salmon.

T H E   I M P O RTA N C E
O F   H A B I TAT   A N D   E CO S Y S T E M S

To  survive  and  prosper,  wild  salmon  need
appropriate  freshwater  and  marine  habitat:  no
habitat, no salmon. Productive habitat in the Pacific
Region  faces  growing  pressures  from  human
activities  that  threaten  the  capacity  to  sustain
salmon populations over the long term. The land
and  water  that  comprise  habitat  important  for
salmon productivity also have significant economic
value  to  non-fishery  uses,  such  as  urban
development,  forestry,  agriculture,  and  other
industries. These competing uses may compromise
the value of the habitat for salmon and associated
species.  An  ongoing  concern  is  that  habitat
productivity  can  deteriorate  as  the  result  of  many
small, incremental and often unidentified impacts
accumulating  over  time.  In  addition,  ocean  and

freshwater  habitat  can  be  affected  by  global-scale
phenomena, such as climate change.

The roles that Pacific salmon play in marine
(oceanic,  coastal,  and  estuarine),  freshwater  (lake,
stream,  and  wetland),  and  terrestrial  ecosystems
(adjacent to streams and rivers, the riparian zone)
have  also  become  a  significant  issue  in  salmon
management. The  acceptance  of  the  influence  of
marine  ecosystems  on  salmon  survival  and
production has undoubtedly been one of the major
advances  in  recent  knowledge  about  Pacific
salmonids.  This  policy
includes  actions  to
progressively  account  for  ecosystem  values  in
salmon management.

Habitat  pressures  will  continue  to  grow  as
human  populations  increase  and,  with  them,
demands  for  space,  food,  and  livelihood.  The
challenge for habitat managers is to regulate social
and economic activities to avoid or mitigate adverse
impacts  on  fish  habitat,  in  cooperation  with  First
Nations, Provincial, Territorial, and local governments.
The new management approach needs to meet this
challenge more effectively and maintain habitat and
ecosystem  integrity  for  the  long-term  health  of
Pacific salmon populations.

4Slaney et al. (1996), “Status of anadromous salmon and trout in British Columbia and the Yukon.” The numbers reported here exclude steelhead,
which are not covered by this policy. The paper assessed trends in 4,906 combinations of species within streams (i.e., a stream with three species
spawning would account for three spawning locations). The 4,906 spawning locations were 60 per cent of the total number of known locations, but
the remaining 40 per cent did not have adequate data to support an assessment.

The  diversity  in  Pacific  salmon  described  above
refers  to  genetic  variation  and  adaptations  to
different  environments  that  have  accumulated
between populations of salmon. The abundance of
spawning salmon is understood to be important for
the  future  production  of  salmon,  and  it  is  also
critical for the maintenance of genetic variation or
diversity within populations, and for connectedness
of populations that results from straying. A low level
of  straying  between  spawning  groups  provides  an
important source of genetic variation and allows for
colonization of new habitats. In this policy, the term
diversity,  or  salmon  diversity,  refers  to  genetic
variation  and  adaptations  within  and  between
populations of wild Pacific salmon.

Pacific salmon are, however, part of a larger
ecosystem  and  are  components  of  the  total
biological diversity in these natural systems. In this
policy,  biodiversity  (or  biological  diversity)  is
defined  as  the  full  range  of  variety  and  variability
within  and  among  living  organisms  and  the
ecological  complexes  in  which  they  occur;  and
encompasses diversity at the ecosystem, community,
species,  and  genetic  levels  and  the  interaction  of

these components.5 The protection of biodiversity,
and understanding the broader implications of this
term, is also essential to implementation and success
of  this  policy.  The  biodiversity  associated  with
Pacific  salmon  populations  will  influence  the
quality and productivity of the salmon’s ecosystems
and  local  habitats,  and  determines  the  biological
background influencing salmon diversity and their
adaptability.

Canada’s Species at Risk Act (SARA) recognizes
the  importance  of  the  diversity  within  species  by
defining  ‘‘wildlife  species’’  to  mean  “a  species,
subspecies,  variety  or  geographically  or  genetically
distinct  population  of  animal,  plant  or  other
organism, other than a bacterium or virus, that is
wild by nature and (a) is native to Canada; or (b)
has extended its range into Canada without human
intervention and has been present in Canada for at
least 50 years”.6 This policy defines the geographic
or  genetically  distinct  populations  of  salmon  and
the habitats necessary to protect their biodiversity.
These  groupings  of  salmon  fit  the  definition  of
“wildlife species” in SARA.

THE WILD  SALMON  POLICY  –
A  NEW  MANAGEMENT  APPROACH

Within the last decade, various measures have been
implemented to advance the conservation of Pacific
salmon. For example, the commercial fishing fleet
was  reduced,  Canada  and  the  United  States
renewed  the  Pacific  Salmon  Treaty,  and  selective
harvesting  practices  have  been  developed  and
adopted. There is now a greater recognition of the
role  of  wild  salmon
in  Pacific  Northwest
ecosystems.  Each  of  these  actions,  in  turn,  has
contributed  to  the  growth  of  a  more  informed
conservation  ethic  for  Pacific  salmon,  one  that
recognizes  the  inherent  value  of  salmon,  the
importance  of  diversity  among  and  within
populations,  and  the  obvious  and  enduring
cultural, social, and economic benefits.

Although progress has been made in salmon
conservation,  there  are  continuing  challenges  for
some  wild  populations,  their  ecosystems,  and  the
people  that  rely  on  them.  For  example,  three
distinct groups – Interior Fraser River coho, Cultus
Lake  sockeye  in  the  Lower  Fraser,  and  Sakinaw
Lake  sockeye  in  the  Strait  of  Georgia  –  were
designated  as  Endangered  by  COSEWIC.  There
has  been  an  increasing  awareness  that  past
management  of  large  fisheries  and  “stocks”  has
failed to adequately protect or recognize the value of
diversity  in  Pacific  salmon.  A  new  approach  to
managing  salmon  production  and  diversity  is
needed to conserve salmon and protect and restore
the full array of benefits they provide to Canadians.
The  impetus  for  a  new  management
approach also comes from the evolution in public
attitudes,  science,  laws  and  decision-making  over
the  past  twenty  years.  Thousands  of  volunteer
streamkeepers  and  many  local  watershed  groups
now actively protect and restore Pacific salmon and
habitat.  Biologists  are  learning  more  about  the
genetic  diversity  of  wild  salmon,  the  impact  of
climate on survival, and the relationship of salmon
to  their  habitat  and  surrounding  ecosystems. The
Species  at  Risk  Act mandates  the  protection  of
geographically  or  genetically  distinct  populations
with  a  high  probability  of  extinction,  while  the
Oceans Act calls for integrated resource management
and  an  ecosystem  perspective.  First  Nations
governments and non-governmental organizations
are  demanding  more  involvement  in  decisions
about wild salmon.

Expectations for the management of Pacific
salmon  today  require  a  more  proactive,  forward-
looking approach that sets clear conservation goals
and  acknowledges  the  importance  of  protecting
biodiversity  for  sustaining  diverse  healthy  wild
salmon  populations,  their  habitats,  and  associated
benefits.  Together with the enjoyment wild salmon
provide, their place in our cultural identity, and the
expectations  of  Canadians
responsible
stewardship,  these  factors  make  a  compelling  case

for

for a new policy approach. The Wild Salmon Policy
takes account of consultations with First Nations,
user  groups,  and  the  general  public  on  draft
discussion papers released in 2000, 2004, and early
2005.7

The  policy  that  follows  will  guide  future
decisions to conserve wild salmon and their habitat
in  BC  and  the  Yukon.  It  neither  amends  nor
overrides existing legislation or regulations, but will
serve  as  the  blueprint  that  will  govern  how  these
statutory authorities will be implemented.

This  policy  will  facilitate  an  adaptive
approach  to  salmon  conservation  in  BC  and  the
Yukon.  By  choice,  decision-making  is  achieved
through  an  inclusive  process,  rather  than  through
the establishment of a set of predetermined rules.
The  policy  defines  objectives  and  describes
conservation  outcomes,  but  it  does  not  prescribe
decision  rules  that  would  restrict  its  application.
This  approach  is  well-suited  to  dealing  with  the
circumstances  that  pertain  to  salmon.  Choices
about conservation will be made openly, with input

from  First  Nations,  and  local  and  region  wide
stakeholder groups, to ensure that decisions reflect
societal  values.  Management  of  wild  salmon  and
their  habitat  is  complex,  and  the  problems
encountered are diverse. It is not feasible to design
rules  that  anticipate  and  adequately  address  all
eventualities that will be encountered. A deterministic
approach is inflexible, can eliminate the exercise of
judgement, and may result in the wrong solution,
or  impose  significant  unnecessary  costs.  The
approach  adopted  in  this  policy  avoids  these
problems, and offers increased opportunities for the
consideration  of  alternatives,  such  as  habitat
initiatives,  to  assist  in  addressing  protection  and
rebuilding of salmon. Finally, the approach selected
is compatible with the Fisheries Act, and consistent
with the principle of Ministerial discretion.

This  policy  describes  how  DFO  will  meet  its  responsibilities  for  the
conservation of wild Pacific salmon. It stipulates an overall policy goal for
wild  salmon,  identifies  basic  principles  to  guide  resource  management
decision-making, and sets out objectives and strategies to achieve the goal
(Figure 1).

The successful implementation of this policy will provide Canadians

with:

• Healthy, diverse, and abundant wild salmon populations for future

generations;

• Sustainable  fisheries  to  meet  the  needs  of  First  Nations  and
contribute to the current and future prosperity of all Canadians;
and

• Improved accounting for ecosystem values in salmon and habitat

management decisions.

Wild Salmon Policy

Important Terminology:
Conservation and Sustainable Use

The intent of this policy is to provide
a framework for the conservation and
sustainable use of wild Pacific salmon.
These terms – “Conservation” and
“Sustainable Use” mean different
things to different people. Some
definitions of conservation include
sustainable use, implying that
protection of the biological processes
and use of resources are both
components of conservation. Other
definitions, such as in the Convention
on Biological Diversity, separate the
two concepts, and present them as
related, but distinct considerations. In
this policy,these terms are differentiated.
Conservation is the protection,
maintenance, and rehabilitation of
genetic diversity, species, and ecosystems
to sustain biodiversity and the
continuance of evolutionary and natural
production processes.8

This definition identifies the
primacy of conservation over use, and
separates issues associated with
constraints on use from allocation and
priority amongst users.

Sustainable Use is the use of
biological resources in a way and at a
rate that does not lead to their long
term decline, thereby maintaining the
potential for future generations to meet
their needs and aspirations.

As a resource management
agency, DFO is committed to the
sustainable use of wild salmon
resources.The intent of this policy is
to protect the biological foundation of
wild Pacific salmon to provide the
fullest benefits presently and for future
generations. In the long term,
protection of biodiversity will provide
the greatest opportunity for maintaining
sustainable benefits to Canadians.

enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity.

All  decisions  and  activities  pertaining  to  the  conservation  of  wild

Pacific salmon will be guided by four principles:

Principle 1  Conservation.
Conservation of wild Pacific salmon and their habitats is the highest priority in
resource management decision-making.

The protection and restoration of wild Pacific salmon and their habitats
will enable the long-term health and productivity of wild populations and
continued provision of cultural, social and economic benefits. To safeguard
the long-term viability of wild Pacific salmon in natural surroundings, the
Department will strive to maintain healthy populations in diverse habitats.

Principle 2  Honour obligations to First Nations.
Resource management processes and decisions will honour Canada’s obligations
to First Nations.

This  includes  Canada’s  legal  duty  to  consult  with  First  Nations  and,
depending on the strength of the claim of Aboriginal rights or Aboriginal
title and the seriousness of the potential adverse effect of a decision on the

(cid:228)
(cid:228)
claimed rights or title, accommodate their interests
when  Canada  has  knowledge  of  the  potential
existence  of  an  Aboriginal  right  or  Aboriginal  title
and is making decisions that might adversely affect
the  right  or  title.  Resource  management  processes
and  decisions  will  also  be  in  accordance  with  the
Nisga’a  Final  Agreement,  the  Yukon  Final
Agreements,  and  any  other  treaties  or  agreements
entered into between Canada and First Nations.

Principle 3  Sustainable Use.
Resource  management  decisions  will  consider
biological,  social,  and  economic  consequences,
reflect  best
including  Aboriginal
Traditional Knowledge (ATK), and maintain the
potential for future generations to meet their needs
and aspirations.9

science

Social, economic, and biological considerations will
inform  decisions  on  salmon,  their  habitats,  and
their  ecosystems  consistent  with  the  priorities
assigned  to  Principles  1  and  2.  Conservation
decisions  cannot  be  based  solely  on  biological
information. The maintenance of biodiversity and
healthy  ecosystems  must  be  considered  in  the
context  of  human  needs  for  use  now  and  in  the
future. Decisions will not be taken without regard
to their cost or social consequences.

Principle 4  Open Process.
Resource  management  decisions  will  be  made  in  an
open, transparent and inclusive manner.

To gain broad public support for decision-making,
salmon  management  must  accommodate  a  wide
range of interests in the resource. Decisions about
salmon protection and sustainable use will be based
on meaningful public input to ensure they reflect
society’s values. Decision-making processes will be
transparent  and  governed  by  clear  and  consistent
rules and procedures.

O B J E C T I V E S

To achieve the outcome expressed in the policy goal
for wild salmon, three objectives must be fulfilled:

1. Safeguard  the  genetic  diversity  of  wild

Pacific salmon;

2. Maintain habitat and ecosystem integrity;

and

3. Manage fisheries for sustainable benefits.

Key  considerations  associated  with  each  of

these objectives are described below.

Objective 1
Safeguard the genetic diversity
of wild Pacific salmon
To  sustain  Pacific  salmon  and  their  associated
benefits, it is necessary to safeguard their geographic
and  genetic  diversity  and  their  habitats.  While
maintaining  diversity  is  broadly  accepted  as
essential  for  the  health  of  wild  salmon,  the
significant scientific and policy issue is how much
diversity? The genetic diversity of a species includes

10 Wild Salmon Policy

The Population Structure of
Wild Salmon

Salmon have a complex hierarchical
population structure extending from
groups of salmon at individual
spawning sites all the way up to
taxonomic species.Their precise
homing to natal streams and their
death after spawning restrict gene
flow among fish at different spawning
locations. However, since some
salmon stray, genetic exchange also
occurs among fish from different
persistent spawning sites (demes) in a
geographic area.These interactions
form a geographic network of demes
and the basic level of genetic
organization in Pacific salmon.
The likelihood of genetic
exchange decreases with increased
distance between streams, or with
greater physical differences between
streams. Fewer strays and less genetic
mixing result in less genetic similarity
between fish in these streams.
Eventually, as distance or environmental
differences grow to severely limit gene
flow, the spawning groups will function
as separate lineages.These
independently functioning aggregates
are defined as Conservation Units
in this policy.

Between localized demes and
the geographic boundary of a CU are
usually intermediate groupings called
Populations. A population is a group
of interbreeding salmon that is
sufficiently isolated (i.e., reduced
genetic exchange) from other
populations such that persistent
adaptations to the local habitat can
develop over time. Local adaptations
and genetic differences between
populations are an essential part of
the diversity needed for long-term
viability of Pacific salmon.A CU will
contain one or more populations (see
Figure 2).

every  individual  fish.  Preserving  maximum  genetic  diversity  would
eliminate human harvesting of salmon and prohibit human activities that
might harm salmon habitat. Conversely, to maintain a taxonomic species,
such  as  sockeye  salmon,  but  ignore  within-species  population  structure
would reduce diversity and contravene the intent of the UN Convention
on Biological Diversity, SARA and the intent of this policy.

DFO  intends  to  maintain  diversity  through  the  protection  of
“Conservation Units” (CUs). A CU is a group of wild salmon sufficiently
isolated from other groups that, if extirpated is very unlikely to recolonize
naturally within an acceptable timeframe, such as a human lifetime or a
specified number of salmon generations.

There  are  important  implications  to  this  definition  of  a
Conservation  Unit.  The  persistence  of  salmon  within  the  CU,  and  its
associated production, demand responsible management of its population
structure and habitats, as well as the ability of fish to move among habitat
areas (connectivity). The loss of a CU for the length of a human lifetime
would  clearly  have  serious  consequences  for  the  people  and  other
ecosystem components that benefit from or depend on it.

Over the geographic area of a CU, variations in  habitat type and
quality may result in differences in salmon productivity. Such differences
in  nature  mean  that  not  all  populations  within  a  CU  are  likely  to  be
maintained at equal levels of production or chance of loss. Maintaining
CUs requires protecting populations and demes, but not necessarily all of
them, all of the time. As long as networks of connected demes and streams
within CUs are maintained, any loss of a localized spawning group should
be  temporary.  Maintaining  healthy  abundances  within  CUs  requires
sufficient  spawning  salmon  to  recolonize  depleted  spawning  areas  and
protection of fish habitat to support production and provide connection
between  localized  spawning  groups.  While  salmon  from  neighboring
demes or populations are unlikely to be genetically identical to those lost,
they are likely to be most similar genetically and share many adaptive traits.
Such localized losses, whether due to natural events or human activities,
would not result in extirpation of the CU.

Total  success  in  safeguarding  the  genetic  diversity  of  wild  Pacific
salmon would imply preserving all populations and CUs. Action Steps in
the WSP are prescribed to maintain CUs to the fullest extent possible, but
there  will  likely  be  circumstances  when  losses  of  wild  salmon  are
unavoidable.  Catastrophic  events  are  beyond  human  control  and  the
Department  may  not  be  able  to  restore  habitat  or  spawning  demes
damaged by such events. The rate of climate change in an area may exceed
the ability of some salmon populations to adjust. While it is the clear intent
of this policy to prevent losses resulting from management and use, it is
unrealistic in natural environments to expect all losses can be avoided.

Wild Salmon Policy

11

Conservation Units and the Maintenance of Diversity

Diversity in Pacific salmon reflects genetic and habitat diversity and the evolution of lineages of
salmon over thousands of years10. These precise lineages cannot be replaced once lost, and the
more numerous they are the greater the chances for salmon to adjust to future environmental
changes. Diversity is a kind of insurance that reduces the risk of loss by increasing the likelihood
that species and populations will be able to adapt to changing circumstances and survive.
Furthermore, maintaining the largest number of spawning populations that are adapted to their
individual habitats will result in higher abundances of salmon.

Biologists still have much to learn about the importance of local adaptations at the stream

level, the rate at which salmon adapt, and the value of biodiversity. However, since no one can
foresee the future stresses on wild salmon, a responsible and precautionary approach
recommends conserving a wide diversity of populations and habitats. Pacific salmon have been
diverse and adaptable enough to survive floods and drought, disease, volcanic eruptions, and ice
ages. Their survival strategies should continue to serve them in the future, unless human-caused
pressures become insurmountable. We must ensure that these survival strategies are allowed to
function and not destroyed by our growing human footprint.

Some CUs will encompass large areas and include many streams and localized spawning

groups. Concerns have been expressed that for such large CUs, individual streams and spawning
groups may not be adequately protected even if they are important to local communities. All
local demes and streams have value. In practice, protecting entire CUs with their networks of
spawning groups is the most effective way to protect individual spawning groups and the
interests of local communities.

These networks provide the natural process for recolonizing streams and salmon habitat

(with similar genetically related salmon) that may be lost through natural events or some human
impact. For example, if attention is focused on a local stream and the overall well-being of the
CU is not maintained, then the stream of interest may become isolated from other spawning
groups, and at greater risk of loss, through habitat loss or reduced abundances in neighboring
streams. The critical assumption underlying these processes, however, is the protection and
maintenance of functioning habitat and ecosystems within the CU.

The desired number of spawners for a CU will be established to provide for an adequate
abundance and distribution of salmon throughout its geographic range.  The annual status of the
CU in relation to these targets will guide the development of harvest management plans in the
integrated planning process (Strategy 4).

12 Wild Salmon Policy

Species Differences in
Conservation Units
(see Figure 2)

The number and sizes of CUs will
vary among species. For instance, pink
and chum salmon generally show
fewer genetic differences between
populations and demes than the
other species. Consequently, their
CUs will be relatively large. Similarly,
coho rarely exhibit marked genetic
boundaries, so their CUs will tend to
be large and at times somewhat
difficult to define. Coho show,
however, substantial life history
variation (e.g., lake rearing juveniles, fry
migrants, run timing variation) within a
region. Chinook salmon also show
varied life histories, but the differences
tend to be more geographically
aligned, and so will probably have
more CUs than coho. Sockeye CUs
are probably easiest to identify and
will be the most numerous. Genetic
information strongly suggests that
sockeye CUs will typically be at the
level of an individual sockeye-rearing
lake. In some cases though, it may
turn out that several small sockeye
lakes will constitute one CU, or that
different timing components (“runs”)
within large lakes may represent
separate CUs. The delineation of
CUs in all species will be based on
biological information including
genetic variation, phenotypic traits
(e.g., run timing, life history traits,
ocean distribution, etc.), and aboriginal
traditional knowledge (ATK) if
available. Delineations of CUs are
expected to change over time as
more information and experience is
gained.

Objective 2
Maintain habitat and ecosystem integrity

The health and long-term well-being of wild Pacific salmon is inextricably
linked to the availability of diverse and productive freshwater, coastal, and
marine habitats. Moreover, Pacific salmon have a critical function in the
aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems sustained by these habitats. Salmon play
an  important  role  in  marine  ecosystems,  with  their  bodies  and  waste
products  providing  nutrients  for  organisms  from  microbes  to  top
predators, such as killer whales. In freshwater ecosystems, returning salmon
transport  marine-derived  nutrients  inland.  Salmon  carcasses  sustain
aquatic  and  terrestrial  animals  and  provide  nutrients  to  the  entire
ecosystem including subsequent generations of wild salmon.

Aquatic habitats and their adjacent terrestrial areas are also valued for
a wide range of human requirements. The integrity of salmon habitat is
challenged by human competition for accessible land and fresh water, for
ocean spaces, and for the interconnecting estuarine and coastal areas. In
both freshwater and marine areas, human activities affect water quality. In
estuaries and the marine foreshore, development can affect wild salmon
during critical rearing and migration periods. In the open ocean, activities
such as commercial fishing, shipping, and waste disposal among others can
potentially affect the marine habitat of salmon.

Linking Habitat to
Wild Salmon CUs and
Fish Harvest Planning

A key response of the regional
Habitat Management Program to the
WSP is an increased emphasis on
integrated planning. Fish production
and harvest objectives for wild salmon
CUs will be linked to the
conservation, restoration, and
development of fish habitat.

At the resource planning level,
better habitat protection priorities
will be established by integrating
habitat requirements with the
fisheries resources they support and
with fish management objectives.
Habitat plans will incorporate
knowledge of the current and future
demands on the environment and the
aquatic resources, and will be aligned
with objectives for fisheries and
watersheds for priority CUs.

Identifying, protecting, restoring and rehabilitating aquatic habitats
are critical to maintaining their integrity and sustaining ecosystems. Since
1986, DFO’s Habitat Management Program has been guided by the “no
net  loss”  principle  for  the  protection  of  these  habitats.11 The  first  and
preferred approach is prevention of habitat loss. DFO policy also stipulates
that where a harmful alteration of habitat is authorized by the Minister,
losses shall be compensated by habitat replacement.

The strategies for achieving “no net loss” have focused primarily on
project-by-project review, mainly in freshwater environments. A modern,
more effective approach to achieve “no net loss” must assess the importance
of habitat on an ecosystem basis, and balance the degree and type of impact
with the most effective remedy. In evolving to a more integrated approach,
the Department will make greater use of indicators to assess and monitor
the health of freshwater and marine habitat.

A new focus on the salmon habitat that is most productive, limiting,
or  at  risk  in  a  CU  will  clarify  decision-making  and  better  link  habitat
management strategies to harvest and salmon assessment (Strategy 4). Low
risk  activities,  where  measures  to  avoid  or  mitigate  impacts  are  well
understood,  will  be  dealt  with  through  other  mechanisms  such  as
guidelines and standards. This approach will ensure that all habitats are
addressed and resources are focused where most required.

In order to effectively manage and protect aquatic systems where the
productive capacity of habitat is at highest likelihood of loss, DFO must
integrate its work with that of Provincial and other federal agencies, First
Nations  governments,  stewardship  groups,  industry,  and  stakeholders.
Environment  Canada  has  primary  responsibility  for  administering,  on
behalf of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, pollution prevention and
control authorities contained in the Fisheries Act. However, the jurisdiction
for many of the land and water uses that may be detrimental to salmon
resides  with  Provincial,  Territorial  or  local  governments.  Success  in
protecting and restoring habitat demands a cooperative and collaborative
approach among the various levels of government so that land and water
use activities and decisions better support the needs of salmon. One such
coordinating structure is the Pacific Council of Fisheries and Aquaculture
Ministers and its subsidiary work groups. The council and the work groups
can provide an organizational arrangement within which information can
be shared and cooperative work developed and coordinated. Collaborative
approaches such as this optimize the use of our collective resources.

14 Wild Salmon Policy

Objective 3
Manage fisheries for sustainable benefits

The conservation of wild salmon and their habitat
is  the  highest  priority  in  this  policy.  However,  a
policy  that  failed  to  consider  the  values  that  the
harvesting  of  Pacific  salmon  provide  to  people
would  be  incomplete.  While  everyone  supports
conservation, many people depend on salmon for
their  social  and  economic  needs  and  insist  on  a
balanced policy that provides for sustainable use of
wild salmon.

DFO  has  a  responsibility  to  provide
sustainable  harvesting  opportunities  that  will  best
meet its obligations to First Nations, contribute to
social  well-being,  and  provide  employment  and
other  economic  benefits  to  individuals  and
fisheries-dependent  communities.  A  significant
challenge for this policy is to safeguard the genetic
diversity  of  salmon  while  accounting  for  and
realizing these benefits of the salmon catch. Since
harvest  restrictions  necessary  to  conserve  the  wild
salmon
and
affect
individuals, cultural, social and economic impacts
need to be considered.

communities

resource

Some critics will suggest that consideration of
the  social  and  economic  benefits  arising  from
salmon  harvesting  will  compromise  salmon
conservation.  Others  will  claim  that  a  focus  on
maintaining  diversity  means  the  elimination  of
major salmon fisheries.  In reality, the interests of
both salmon and people need to be accounted for

in  a  successful  conservation  program. This  policy
reflects a management framework that can provide
care and respect for a resource and its ecosystem and
for the people within it. Protecting the resource base
provides  the  maximum  potential  for  benefits  to
people. The full measure of the WSP’s success will
be  the  achievement  of  salmon  conservation
accompanied by human well-being.

Making  the  best  decisions  on  salmon
conservation cannot be done by scientists or other
technical  specialists  alone.  While  choices  must
certainly  be  informed  by  scientific  and  technical
information,  the  best  decisions  will  ultimately
reflect  public  values.  This  requires  structured
processes that: (1) establish specific objectives and
priorities,  and  (2)  allow  the  biological,  social  and
economic  consequences  of  different  conservation
measures  and  activities  to  be  considered  and
weighed in an open and transparent way.

First  Nations,  harvesters,  environmental
groups,  and  community  interests  in  the  resource
need to be engaged directly in these processes, and
in  the  determination  of  the  most  appropriate
management  actions.  Individual  and  community
involvement  in  salmon  management  decision-
making, in turn, will sustain the social and cultural
ties  between  people  and  salmon.  These  ties  will
ultimately lead to the more successful implementation
of conservation plans and the better protection of
wild salmon.

S T R AT E G I E S   A N D   AC T I O N   S T E P S

This  policy  will  be  implemented  through  six
strategies  summarized  in  Table  1.  Strategies  1
through 3 provide the information on wild salmon
populations, their habitats, and ecosystems required
as information for decision-making and planning.
Strategy  4  requires  the  integration  of  biological,
social, and economic information to produce long-
term  strategic  plans  for  salmon  and  habitat
management for each conservation unit. Strategy 5
is  the  translation  of  strategic  plans  into  annual
operational plans and Strategy 6 is a commitment
to  ongoing  review  of  the  implementation  and
success of the Policy.

The WSP and the Precautionary Approach

Article 6.2:  "States shall be more cautious when information is uncertain, unreliable or inadequate.
The absence of adequate scientific information shall not be used as a reason for postponing or failing
to take conservation and management measures."

Article 6.2 of the UN Agreement (Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling
Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, 1995)12 builds from the original declaration of a
precautionary approach (Principle 15, Rio Declaration on Environment and Development,
1992), and is also included in the United Nations Fisheries and Agriculture Organization Code
of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (1995).

Precautionary approaches are now widely applied in fisheries management and the

protection of marine ecosystems. The approach identifies important considerations for
management: acknowledgement of uncertainty in information and future impacts and the need
for decision making in the absence of full information. It implies a reversal in the burden of
proof and the need for longer term outlooks in conservation of resources.

The application of precaution in the WSP will follow the guidance provided to Federal

Departments by the Privy Council Office publication13 entitled "A Framework for the Application
of Precaution in Science-based Decision Making About Risk." (Canada, Privy Council Office 2003).
That Framework includes five principles of precaution:

• The application of the precautionary approach is a legitimate and distinctive decision-

making approach within a risk management framework.

• Decisions should be guided by society’s chosen level of risk.

• Application of the precautionary approach should be based on sound scientific

information.

• Mechanisms for re-evaluation and transparency should exist.

• A high degree of transparency, clear accountability, and meaningful public involvement

are appropriate.

The WSP will adhere to the use of precaution and be consistent with the Privy Council

Office framework and FAO14 (1995, paragraph 6 (a-h)). For example, the introduction of a lower
benchmark (Strategy 1) is a significant precautionary step in the conservation of Pacific salmon.
In determining the value of the benchmark, all sources of uncertainty in assessment of the CU
must be determined (for estimation of the buffer) and the Department and advisors must
determine a risk tolerance to be applied in a risk management framework. Where assessment
information is highly uncertain, more precautionary lower benchmarks will be defined.

This policy requires a systematic process to organize
all Pacific salmon streams and lakes into geographic
units  for  conservation  and  specification  of  the
means  to  monitor  abundance  and  distribution  of
Pacific  salmon  within  those  units  over  time. The
following Action Steps present how the Department
will identify and assess wild salmon in BC and the
Yukon  in  cooperation  with  First  Nations  and
others.

Action Step 1.1.
Identify Conservation Units.
Based on science and local knowledge, the salmon
that  use  particular  freshwater  habitats  will  be
aggregated  into  Conservation  Units.  CUs  will  be
delineated  consisting  of  one  or  more  genetically
similar  interbreeding  populations  and  have  a
defined geographic distribution. A CU will include

15See www-sci.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/sci/psarc/default_e.htm .

genetically  similar  lineages  of  fish,  a  spatial
distribution  of  populations  and  demes,  and  be
dependent  on  a  set  of  habitats.  This  linkage
recognizes  the  need  for  interconnected  spawning
populations for genetic processes, defines important
habitat for these lineages and for future production,
and  identifies  the  groups  of  salmon  whose  status
will be measured under this policy.

than

The  delineation  of  CUs  will  be  based  on
biological  information,  including  genetic  traits
(e.g.,  DNA  variants),  polygenic  traits  (e.g.,  run
timing, life history traits, ocean distribution, etc.),
and  ATK  where  available.  Since  the  requirements
and  needs  of  First  Nations  and  others  may  be  at
some  CUs,
scales
finer  geographic
management  objectives  to  address  these  may  be
recognized  in  Strategic  plans  (Strategy  4).  The
number of CUs for each species will be a function
of  our  knowledge  base  and  is  expected  to  change
over  time.  DFO  will  consult  with  local  First
Nations  in  accordance  with  its  consultation
obligations  during  the  process  of  defining
Conservation Units.  As this work proceeds, it will
be  assessed  through  peer  review  (via  the  Pacific
Scientific  Advice  Review  Committee,  PSARC).15
This  review  process  facilitates  participation  by
outside experts, First Nations, fisheries stakeholders,
and  the  public;  and  will  provide  the  means  to
modify the definition of CUs over time.

Action Step 1.2.
Develop criteria to assess CUs and
identify benchmarks to represent
biological status.
The  biological  status  of  a  CU  will  normally  be
based  on  the  abundance  and  distribution  of
spawners  in  the  unit,  or  proxies  thereof.  When  a
CU contains more than one population, it will be
necessary to determine how abundance is distributed
among the populations. For each CU, higher and
lower benchmarks will be defined that will delimit
three status zones: Green, Amber, and Red (Figure 3).
As  spawner  abundance  decreases,  a  CU  moves
towards  the  lower  status  zone,  and  the  extent  of
management intervention for conservation purposes
will increase.

Biological Status Zones and
Management Response

A Conservation Unit in the Red zone
is undesirable because of the risk of
extirpation, and the loss of ecological
benefits and salmon production. The
presence of a CU in the Red zone
will initiate an immediate
consideration of ways to protect the
fish, increase their abundance, and
reduce the potential risk of loss.
Biological considerations will be the
primary drivers for the management
of CUs with Red status.

Amber status implies caution in
the management of the CU.While a
CU in the Amber zone should be at a
low risk of loss, there will be a degree
of lost production. Still, this situation
may result when CUs share risk
factors with other more productive
units. Decisions about the
conservation of CUs in the Amber
zone will involve broader
consideration of biological, social, and
economic issues. Assuming a CU is
assessed to be safe in the Amber
zone (consistent with Principle 1),
then the use of this CU involves a
comparison of the benefits  from
restoring production versus the costs
arising from limitations imposed on
the use of other CUs to achieve that
restoration.

Social and economic

considerations will tend to be the
primary drivers for the management
of CUs in the Green zone, though
ecosystem or other non-consumptive
use values could also be considered.

Benchmarks identify when the biological production status of a CU has
changed significantly, but do not prescribe specific restrictions. Changes in
status will initiate management actions (see sidebar). The specific responses
will vary among species, geographic regions and cause of the decline and
will be determined through the integrated planning process described in
Strategy  4.  The  use  of  status  zones  and  generic  methods  to  determine
benchmarks  recognizes  variability  in  data  quality  and  quantity  and  is
consistent  with  current  management  approaches  adopted  by  other
agencies.16

The lower benchmark between Amber and Red will be established
at a level of abundance high enough to ensure there is a substantial buffer
between  it  and  any  level  of  abundance  that  could  lead  to  a  CU  being
considered at risk of extinction by COSEWIC. The buffer will account for
uncertainty in data and control of harvest management. There is no single
rule to use for determination of the lower benchmark. Rather, it will be
determined on a case-by-case basis, and depend on available information,
and the risk tolerance applied. The determination of the risk tolerance to
apply is a value judgement that requires consultation with First Nations
and others affected by this choice.

Example criteria, depending on the species and types of information,

may be:17

• The spawning escapement required to produce a percentage of the

maximum juvenile abundance (say 10–25%);

• The spawning escapement estimated to permit recovery with an
agreed probability within an acceptable period of time (e.g., 75%
confidence within three salmon generations);

(2004b),  Proceedings  of  the  National  Meeting  on  Applying  the  Precautionary  Approach  in  Fisheries
Management.

17The  values  presented  in  these  example  criteria  are  for  explanation  only  and  do  not  limit  any
consideration of other values or other criteria that may be determined for a specific CU.

18 Wild Salmon Policy

• The  abundance  and  distribution  of
spawners within a CU sufficient to provide
confidence  that  the  CU  does  not  have  a
high  probability  of  extirpation  (e.g.,  <5%
chance of loss over 50 years); or

• A proportion of the number of spawners (S)
estimated  necessary  to  provide  maximum
sustained  yield  (MSY)  on  an  average
annual  basis  given  existing  environmental
conditions (e.g., 25 per cent of Smsy).

Within the Red zone, there will be a level of
abundance  that  cannot  sustain  further  mortalities
due  to  fishing  or  change  to  freshwater  or  marine
habitats. Further mortality in such a CU will lead to
continued  decline  in  the  spawner  abundance  and
an increasing probability of extirpation. Determining
this level in the zone is a continuing discussion in
salmon assessment literature and is not specified in
this  policy.  The  Department  will  prepare  and
publish operational guidelines on the estimation of
this  level. The  management  response  to  this  level
will  be  determined  on  a  case  by  case  basis,  in
consultation with First Nations, and others affected
by this determination.

The  higher  benchmark  between  Green  and
Amber  will  be  established  to  identify  whether
harvests are greater or less than the level expected to
provide, on an average annual basis, the maximum
annual  catch  for  a  CU,  given  existing  environ-
mental conditions. This level will vary through time
but there would not be a high probability of losing

18See Hilborn and Walters (1992), Quantitative fisheries stock assessment.

the CU. As with the lower benchmark, the upper
benchmark  will  also  be  determined  on  a  case-by-
case  basis  depending  on  the  species  and  types  of
information available, and may apply:

• A proportion of the number of spawners (S)
estimated  necessary  to  provide  maximum
sustainable  yield  (MSY)  on  an  average
annual  basis  given  existing  environmental
conditions (e.g., Smsy);

• An exploitation rate for the CU that would
limit  harvest  based  on  a  rate  of  fishing
mortality  rather  than  the  number  of  fish
killed;

• The  number  of  smolts  (or  spawners)
estimated  to  correspond  with  habitat
capacity; or

• A  proportion  of  the  long  term  average

spawning abundance.

Action Step 1.3.
Monitor and assess status of CUs.
Salmon  assessment  involves  the  use  of  various
analyses to make quantitative predictions about the
reaction of a population to alternative management
plans.18 Two  important  components  of  this
statement  are
that  assessments  should  be
quantitative  and  are  conducted  to  provide  advice
for  management  (including  conservation  when
necessary). For wild salmon in the BC and Yukon,
however, quantitative assessment is a complex and
potentially  costly  task,  involving  numerous  data
sources and hundreds of populations.  Consequently,
the Department has utilized three levels of annual
monitoring  programs  in  the  assessment  of  Pacific
salmon:

i) Indicator systems: Comprehensive programs
involving  quantitative  information  on  the
spawning adults, juveniles produced, mature
progeny produced (reported in the catch and
spawning numbers) from the specific system.
These  programs  are  the  most  information
rich  and  expensive  but  provide  critical
information  for  management  such  as
productivity  and  sustainable  rates  of

(cid:228)
Wild Salmon Policy

19

exploitation  (population  dynamic  values),
survival  rates  for  major  life  history  phases
(e.g.,  freshwater  and  marine  survival),  and
exploitation patterns and rates in fisheries.

ii) Intensive monitoring: Annual surveys of
the numbers of salmon in specific subsets of
streams or habitats within a geographic area.
These  surveys  involve  quantitative  designs
that  can  be  replicated  annually  to  provide
consistent indices of spawners between years.
The accuracy and precision of the estimates
will  vary  with  methodologies  and  habitats
but the essential component is that there is a
high  degree  of  confidence  that  inter-annual
trends  are  accurately  assessed.  For  example,
methods  may  involve  in-river  test  fisheries,
counting  weirs,  mark-recapture  programs,
area-under-the-curve estimators, and surveys
of juvenile production in streams and lakes.

iii)  Extensive  monitoring: Surveys  that  are
generally  the  least  expensive  but  enable  the
broadest coverage of streams or other habitats
within  a  geographic  area. These  surveys  are
useful  for  examining  salmon  distribution,
consistency  of  patterns  throughout  the
region, and checks on habitat changes. They
are  usually  visually  based,  may  be  repeated
within  a  year,  and  may  include  randomly
selected samples of the streams or habitats in
a  large  geographic  area.  Examples  of  these
surveys are over-flights, stream walks or floats,
and could involve only  portions of a stream
instead of the entire system.

For  each  CU,  a  statistically  based  and  cost
effective monitoring plan will be designed and will
build on existing programs and local partnerships
(e.g., First Nations agreements, local Streamkeeper
or  enhancement  groups).  Monitoring  programs
must assess the annual abundance of the CU and
the  distribution  of  spawners.  The  assessment
procedures  applied  will  vary  between  CUs  but
monitoring plans for each CU will be documented
and information reported annually. The benchmarks
specified for a CU must be stated in units consistent

with the monitoring program for that CU in order
that the annual status of the CU can be assessed. A
core program (i.e., an agreed minimum monitoring
plan)  will  be  established  by  the  Department  and
partners and funded annually to maintain the long-
term  information  fundamental to  management  of
local salmon resources. Each monitoring plan will
be  peer  reviewed  to  ensure  application  of
appropriate  designs  and    methods,  best  use  of
available  resources  for  monitoring,  and  to  ensure
that  information  management  systems  have  been
developed.  A  key  objective  of  these  monitoring
programs will be to make certain that data collected
are utilized and timely for the provision of advice.
Assessment results for a CU compared to its
two benchmarks will determine the biological status
of the CU. This status determination will help to
guide  resource  management  planning  and  further
stock  assessment  activities.  When  a  CU  is  in  the
Green zone, a detailed analytical assessment of its
biological status will not usually be needed. For a
CU in the Amber zone, a detailed assessment may
be necessary as input to Strategies 2 and 3 below. If
the  CU  is  classified  as  Red,  a  detailed  assessment
will normally be triggered to examine impacts on
the CU of fishing, habitat degradation, and other
human
for
restoration.

20 Wild Salmon Policy

STRATEGY TWO
ASSESSMENT  OF  HABITAT  STATUS

The  maintenance  of  sound,  productive  salmon
habitat  in  both  fresh  water  and  the  marine
environment  depends  on  good
scientific
information,  timely  measures  to  prevent  habitat
disruption,  and  compliance  with  regulatory
directives.  Habitat  management  and  protection
require  identification  of  the  habitats  necessary  for
the conservation of wild salmon and assessment of
changes in their status over time. This will enable
the  evaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of  regulatory,
planning  and  public  awareness  measures,
establishment  of  priorities,  and  guide  regulatory
and  enforcement  interventions.  Strategy  2  will
address
thereby
complementing  DFO  regulatory  and  compliance
programs and improving our capacity to proactively
monitor and protect habitat.

information  needs,

these

An overview of important habitat and habitat
issues  within  CUs  will  be  developed  and    habitat
status will be assessed using indicators that combine
scientific  and  local  knowledge  and  recognize
sensitive life stages and habitats.  Indicators will be
selected to be reflective of overall habitat health then
tracked  to  assist  in  habitat  planning  within  DFO
and  other  jurisdictions,  including  First  Nations

governments,  the  Province  of  BC  and  local
governments.  Habitat  data  gathered  from  many
sources within and outside DFO will be linked and
made  more  accessible  for  habitat  planning.  The
assessment will highlight good quality habitat that
needs  to  be  maintained  and  protected,  and
degraded  habitats  that  need  to  be  restored  or
rehabilitated  on  the  scale  of  watersheds  and
Conservation Units to inform strategic and annual
planning  for  salmon  conservation.  Through
integrated  resource  planning,  DFO’s  Habitat
Management  Program  will  evolve  to  link  habitat
protection,  resource  assessment  and  stewardship
with fish production.

These Action Steps represent a major change
and will be implemented progressively to improve
the effectiveness of DFO’s program for protecting
salmon habitat. The reshaping of the program will
focus  regulatory  and  enforcement  responsiveness
and  effectiveness,  strengthen  linkages  between
habitat  protection  and  fish  production  objectives,
and  provide  guidance  to  watershed  planning
initiatives.

Action Step 2.1.
Document habitat characteristics within CUs
Habitat  requirements  for  Pacific  salmon  vary  by
species,  life  history  characteristics  and  phase,  and
geography. CUs identified in Strategy 1 will include
genetically similar lineages that are dependent on a
set  of  habitats.  The  identification  of  the  habitats
that  support  or  limit  salmon  production  in
watersheds  and  CUs  will  inform  assessment,
monitoring and protection priorities.

Information  from  multiple  sources  will  be
assembled by DFO at appropriate geographic scales
to describe habitat conditions for individual CUs.
Such  sources  include  government  agencies,  First
Nations,  watershed-based  fish  sustainability  plans,
existing  watershed  processes,  stewardship  groups
and  oceans  integrated  management.  An  overview
report  will  be  prepared  for  each  CU  that  will
provide  sufficient  information  on  key  habitats  to
for  protection,
identify
rehabilitation, and restoration.  It will also identify
information gaps and factors, such as water quality
and  quantity,  that  potentially  threaten  the  future

initial  priorities

health and productivity of habitats in the CU. This
information will contribute to watershed planning
with First Nations governments, industry, stewards
and other jurisdictions and will serve as an effective
initial  guide  for  habitat  protection  and  planning
priorities  in  Strategies  4  and  5.  This  improved
understanding  of  salmon  habitats  will  also  be
valuable as an educational tool for stakeholders.

Action Step 2.2.
Select indicators and develop
benchmarks for habitat assessment
A variety of quantitative and qualitative indicators
of  habitat  status  exist.  In  fresh  water,  examples
include water quality, temperature, stream flow, fish
and  invertebrate  densities,  and  features  such  as
quantities of good quality gravel. In estuarine and
marine  environments,  Marine  Environmental
Quality standards may be used along with physical
habitat indicators.

Indicators for CU’s on a watershed scale will
be selected to assess the quantity and quality of the
habitats  identified  in  Action  Step  2.1.    Indicators
may be general across CU’s or specifically selected
on a case-by-case basis for specific CU’s and habitat
types.  Government  agencies,  First  Nations
governments,  watershed  planning  processes  and
stewardship groups will be asked to provide advice
on the development or selection of key indicators
for their watersheds, based on local knowledge and
information on the kinds of data that are available.
Benchmarks will be developed to reflect the
desired  values  of  each  key  indicator.  For  example
benchmarks  for  water  temperatures  could  reflect
optimal temperature range for salmon and will vary
by species.  Similarly, for an indicator such as gravel
quality, the proportion of fine sediment as substrate
in  spawning  areas  could  be  utilized.  Biological
status indicators may also be used to validate habitat
benchmarks. Benchmarks will be set that reflect our
intent to take action to protect and restore habitat
on  a  preventative  basis  as  required,  before
population  abundance  declines  in  response  to
degraded habitat.

The product of this Action Step will be a set
of  indicators  for  CUs  and  benchmarks  for  the
indicators.

Action Step 2.3.
Monitor and assess habitat status
Based on the framework described in Action Steps
2.1  and  2.2,  ongoing  monitoring  will  be
implemented  to  identify  changes  in  habitat
condition  over  time.  This  monitoring  will  be
integrated with salmon assessments and ecosystem
evaluations. The intent will be to better understand
the  relationship  between  changes  in  habitat
condition and changes in salmon production and
distribution within the CU. Monitoring will also be
used  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  regulatory
decisions and rehabilitation measures. All monitoring
results  will  inform  both  longer-term  strategic
planning  and  annual  operations  in  habitat
management.  If  a  decline  in  habitat  quality  or
quantity over time is detected, efforts will be made
to identify the causes and response measures will be
considered  as  part  of  an  integrated  management
plan for the Conservation Unit.

The  implementation  of  monitoring  and
assessment  of  habitat  status  will  provide  four  key
inputs to guide habitat management. These are:

• Important habitat in need of protection to

maintain salmon productivity;

• Habitat  risks  and  constraints  that  are

adversely affecting that productivity;

• Areas  where  habitat

restoration  or
rehabilitation would be desirable to restore
or enhance productivity; and

• Investigations to fill information gaps.

(cid:228)
(cid:228)
22 Wild Salmon Policy

These  key  inputs  will  also  guide  the
integrated  strategic  plans  (Strategy  4),  where  long
term  priorities
for  habitat  protection  and
restoration will be established to complement fish
production objectives and Strategy 5 where annual
plans  will  be  developed,  including  ongoing
compliance and regulatory functions. These inputs
will also be useful for other jurisdictions responsible
for components of salmon habitat.

This  information  will  allow  DFO  to
recognize and protect the habitats required for the
conservation of wild salmon using tools appropriate
to the circumstances. Through risk assessment and
planning,  efforts  will  be  focused  where  there  are
activities  with  a  high  likelihood  of  significant
impacts and where there are sensitive and important
habitats. Activities with a low likelihood of impact
or those that impact other habitats will be dealt with
through  the  use  of  guidelines  and  standards.  All
habitats will be addressed but protection and recovery
efforts will vary depending on the habitat value.

Action Step 2.4.
Establish linkages to develop an
integrated data system for watershed
management
Together  with  the  Province  of  British  Columbia
and other partners, DFO will promote the design,
implementation,  and  maintenance  of  a  linked,
collaborative system to increase access to information
on  fish  habitat  status.  A  more  unified  salmon

habitat data system can be achieved by improving
common  access  to  the  extensive  data  holdings  of
DFO,  Provincial  and  Territorial  agencies,  other
levels of government, and stakeholders that describe
watersheds  and  habitat  conditions.  Improved
sharing of information will accelerate and strengthen
assessment and reporting of habitat status for CUs.
Over time, it will also allow cumulative changes in
habitats and wild salmon status to be identified and
appropriate actions taken.

STRATEGY 3
INCLUSION OF ECOSYSTEM VALUES
AND MONITORING

Pacific  salmon  play  important  roles  in  marine
(oceanic,  coastal,  and  estuarine),  freshwater  (lake,
stream,  and  wetland),  and  terrestrial  ecosystems
(adjacent to streams and rivers, the riparian zone).
There  is  ample  scientific  evidence  demonstrating
that  nutrients  derived  from  salmon  carcasses  are
important  to  freshwater  and  riparian  ecosystems.
However,  few  studies  provide  advice  on  the
numbers of salmon necessary for healthy freshwater
ecosystems,  or  link  these  ecosystems  with  the
dramatic effect that changes in climate and marine
conditions can have on the survival and production
of  Pacific  salmon.  For  example,  it  is  now  known
that the ocean’s capacity for salmon production can
be limited, is highly variable over time, and can have
an  enormous  effect  on  the  abundance  and
condition of adult salmon (e.g., body size, energy
content). Survival rates from when salmon enter the
sea until they return to coastal waters as adults have
been measured to vary by more than a hundredfold
(even a thousand fold in some cases).

A challenge for the Wild Salmon Policy is the
need  for  development  of  an  ecosystem  objective
that is widely appreciated but difficult to quantify.
Coupled with this uncertainty is increasing concern
for long-term climate change that will affect marine
and  freshwater  ecosystems.  Monitoring  this
variation and implementing appropriate management
responses  to  address  potential  impacts  will  be
increasingly  important  to  future  conservation
efforts.

(cid:228)
The  Department’s  intent  is  to  progressively  consider  ecosystem
values in salmon management, but it acknowledges a limited ability to do
so  at  the  present  time.  The  following  steps  will  provide  the  scientific
understanding  and  technical  capacity  to  include  ecosystem  values  over
time.

Action Step 3.1.
Identify indicators to monitor status
of freshwater ecosystems
The Department will use existing data and expert advice to identify key
indicators (biological, physical, and chemical) of the current and potential
state  of  lake  and  stream  ecosystems  (diversity  of  organisms,  rates  of
biological production, etc.). Within two years, an ecosystem monitoring
and assessment approach will be developed and integrated with ongoing
assessments and reporting on the status of wild salmon. Implementation of
this  approach  will  be  coordinated  with  the  monitoring  of  CU  status
(Action Step 1.3), their habitats (Action Step 2.3), and marine conditions
(Action  Step  3.2).  In  the  process,  knowledge  gaps  and  areas  requiring
further research will also be identified.

Action Step 3.2.
Integrate climate and ocean information
into annual salmon management processes
To understand changes in climate and oceans and their consequences for
salmon production, the freshwater monitoring programs identified in Step 3.1
will  be  integrated  with  programs  investigating  variability  in  climate  and
ocean conditions. Canada is developing programs to monitor and study
these conditions. To relate variations in freshwater and marine ecosystems,
networks of freshwater indicator systems (see Action Step 1.3) are being
discussed  internationally  to  assess  the  magnitude  and  spatial  scale  of
changes  in  climate  and  ocean  conditions.  Linking  variations  in  salmon
returns to changes in the marine ecosystems requires large-scale monitoring
programs,  extensive  planning,  and  collaboration  with  domestic  and
international organizations.

Information on climate and marine conditions will continue to be
provided through DFO’s State of the Ocean reports, and will be linked
with assessments of the marine survival of Pacific salmon. Coupled with
results from Action Step 3.1 and ongoing assessment of salmon survival,
research in this area should lead to improved understanding of production
dynamics and better management of Pacific salmon. This step is also linked
to  Canada’s  Oceans  Strategy,  which  recognizes  the  need  to  better
understand ecosystem dynamics, including climate variability and impact
of change on living marine resources.

A  more  comprehensive  view  of  salmon  production  and  its
determinants,  from  egg  to  spawning  adult,  is  necessary  to  direct
management  actions  more  accurately  and  effectively  conserve  Pacific
salmon resources in an uncertain future.

Climate Change
and Wild Salmon

There is increasing evidence and
support that the world’s climate is
changing and, in particular, that “global
warming” is taking place.19

The climate-related effects
anticipated for wild salmon are
difficult to predict. Common
expectations include increased
summer water temperatures, changes
in seasonal flows, more extreme flow
events, and changes to ecosystems.
When and where change occurs will
also be highly variable. So how can the
Wild Salmon Policy possibly protect
Pacific salmon against these events?
The WSP will have limited ability to
directly protect salmon from climate
change, but the policy’s premise – to
protect diversity and their habitats –
is critical to allowing Pacific salmon to
adapt to future changes. By
maintaining the genetic diversity of
wild salmon and the integrity of their
habitat and ecosystems, the WSP will
help ensure viable wild salmon
populations in the future.At the same
time, while salmon adjust to these
pressures, managers could expect
productivity and allowable catches to
decline.

The importance of protecting

diversity and maintaining healthy
diverse populations of fish was also
recognized as an important strategy in
a recent federal government report
on climate change impacts and
adaptation.20

Panel on Climate Change (www.ipcc.ch/)

Recent Progress Towards
Integrated Management – the
Integrated Salmon Harvest
Planning Committee

Some early progress towards
integrated management has already
been achieved with salmon harvest
planning in BC. For example, the
recently formed Integrated Salmon
Harvest Planning Committee includes
elected representatives from all
commercial gear and area groups, and
representatives nominated by First
Nations and the sports fishing
community, non-governmental
environmental organizations, and the
Province of British Columbia. As
operation of this committee evolves, it
will help to provide inclusive and
balanced information for the
development of commercial and
recreational fishing plans that respect
First Nations food, social and
ceremonial fisheries and other
obligations to First Nations.This is a
useful starting point, but much more
needs to be done to link the work of
the committee with other more
localized watershed-based planning
processes and interests, as well as
with broader marine area planning
initiatives.

I N T E G R AT E D   S T R AT E G I C   P L A N N I N G

The  life  cycle  of  Pacific  salmon  necessitates  a  planning  process  that
addresses  salmon  conservation  from  the  eggs  in  the  gravel  in  parental
generations to the eggs in the gravel produced by their offspring (see Figure 4).
Planning  for  Pacific  salmon  presently  falls  short  of  this  need.    Many
different planning activities currently take place, each with its own role but
operating in relative independence from others. A demanding challenge in
implementing  the  Wild  Salmon  Policy  will  be  the  establishment  of  an
effective planning process that fully addresses the conservation of Pacific
salmon,  meets  the  federal  government’s  obligations  to  First  Nations,
considers  the  needs  of  other  Canadians,  and  involves  those  affected  by
decisions. Strategy 4 is intended to address this challenge.

The purpose of Strategy 4 is to develop long-term strategic plans for
CUs and groups of CUs and their habitat subject to common risk factors.
These  plans  will  account  for  their  biological  status  and  provide
recommendations  on  salmon  conservation  that  reflect  the  interests  of
people  at  local  and  regional  levels.  Strategies  1,  2  and  3  will  provide
information on the status of the CUs, their habitat and the ecosystem as
inputs to the planning process. However, strategic plans need to integrate
this information and:

• Specify long-term biological targets for CUs and groups of CUs

that ensure conservation and sustainable use;

• Identify recommended resource management actions to protect or
restore Pacific salmon, their habitats, and ecosystems in order to
achieve these targets; and

• Establish timeframes and priorities for actions.

Consistent with the goal and objectives of the WSP, the plans must
be designed to safeguard the genetic diversity of wild salmon, maintain the
integrity  of  their  habitat  and  ecosystem  and  result  in  fisheries  that  are
managed for sustainable benefits. To do this, the plans will need to address
the causes of any declines and identify the resource management actions
necessary  to  remedy  them  where  possible.  The  preferred  long-term
outcome  of  the  plans  will  be  healthy  habitat  and  ecosystems  and  CUs
above  their  higher  benchmarks.  But  as  a  minimum,  the  plans  must  be
capable of maintaining and restoring all CUs above their established lower
benchmarks with an acceptable degree of certainty within a defined time
frame. The development of these plans will require choices. The short and
long term benefits as well as costs of decisions must be well documented
and explicitly consider uncertainties in not only the scientific information,
but also in the economic and social information that decision makers use.
Ultimately,  these  strategic  plans  will  inform  the  development  of
annual fishery management, habitat, and enhancement plans and form the
basis  for  ongoing  dialogue  with  First  Nations  governments,  Provincial,
Territorial and local governments and other private parties whose support
and cooperation is essential to sustain Pacific salmon in Canada.

Establishing an integrated process to achieve such plans will not be
easy  or  immediate.  Successful  development  and  implementation  will
require extensive effort and cooperation between all levels of government
and many different interests. Strategy 4 therefore includes two Action Steps
to achieve the goal and objectives of the policy:

• The establishment of an interim process (Step 4.1) that provides

for immediate progress; and

• The development of a new integrated planning structure that will
better meet the needs of the resource over the longer term (Step 4.2).

Action Step 4.1:
Implement an interim process for management of priority CUs
At present across BC and the Yukon, planning related to salmon occurs at
various  geographic  scales  and  for  a  variety  of  purposes.  Bi-lateral
consultations  take  place  with  individual  First  Nations.  Watershed-Based
Fish Sustainability Planning (WFSP) initiatives are underway in local areas
involving  First  Nations  governments,  the  Province,  local  stewardship
groups,  and  other  community  interests  brought  together  to  sustain  fish
habitat. More broadly, Integrated Fisheries Management Plans (IFMP) are
developed for Northern British Columbia, Southern British Columbia, and
the  Yukon  in  consultation  with  individual  harvesting  groups  and  others
interested  in  Pacific  salmon.  Marine  use  planning,  a  key  component  of
Canada’s Ocean Strategy and Action Plan, is proceeding on a pilot basis. At
the broadest geographic scale, the Government of Canada with input from
advisors engages in planning related to the Pacific Salmon Treaty and other
international  agreements  such  as  the  North  Pacific  Anadromous  Fish
Convention.

Linking CUs, Fisheries,
and Watersheds for
Planning Purposes

Salmon management is complex,
involving five species divided into
numerous Conservation Units in
many watersheds that are exploited
by various users in a myriad of
fisheries. Considerations of biology
and geography need to be brought
together in an organized way with
social and economic considerations
for practical and efficient planning and
fully informed decision-making.

In some cases a CU will
encompass a relatively large
geographic area that includes more
than one population or watershed
with a number of discrete fisheries
targeted at sub-components of the
CU. In these cases habitat, fisheries
and marine area planning may need to
proceed at a finer scale than the CU
in its entirety (e.g., perhaps a
watershed scale). In other cases there
will be interdependencies and overlap
between fisheries and among species
within individual watersheds. In these
cases planning for the conservation
and sustainable use of an individual
CU should not be done in isolation
from other CUs within the
watershed.

In these latter circumstances,

CUs may need to be aggregated for
planning purposes. For example, a
wide range of user groups in
numerous different fisheries harvest
Skeena River sockeye salmon. Skeena
River sockeye may include more than
20 CUs originating throughout the
Skeena River drainage system. Habitat,
fisheries, and marine area planning for
any CU within the system must
consider and account for potential
impacts on all the others. As a result,
the appropriate planning unit for
Skeena sockeye will likely encompass
all these associated sockeye CUs and
the entire Skeena River watershed.

Linking CUs, Fisheries,
and Watersheds for
Planning Purposes

Although the resulting plan will

be developed for the aggregate in
these cases, the ultimate effect will be
individual plans for each CU within
the aggregate. Planning choices made
at the aggregate level with respect to
habitat, enhancement, and fisheries
management measures will effectively
translate into impacts on and targets
for each of the individual CUs within
the aggregate. However, the plan for
each individual CU will reflect full
consideration of the impacts on all
other CUs within the aggregate.

It is anticipated that between 50

and 60 planning units (defined by
fisheries, geographic location and
watershed) will be needed to cover
all CUs of Pacific salmon. Some
planning units will encompass com-
ponents of CUs and some will
encompass groups of CUs subject to
one or more common risk factors.
The number and scale of these
planning units will facilitate practical
and efficient planning for wild salmon.

Ultimately, these diverse planning processes and the various interests
involved need to be linked to provide inclusive and comprehensive input to
integrated plans that encompass salmon, fisheries, watersheds, and marine
areas throughout British Columbia and Yukon. In addition, broader and
more direct linkages with First Nations governments, Provincial, Territorial
and local governments need to be forged so that other land and water use
activities and decisions better support the needs of salmon.

Until  a  fully  integrated  planning  process  can  be  established  an
interim  approach  is  needed  that  will  immediately  improve  integration
between habitat, enhancement, fisheries, and marine area planning, and
provide  more  inclusive  input  to  resource  management.  This  interim
approach will meet the Department’s obligations to consult First Nations
and respect the process for salmon planning defined in the Nisga’a Final
Agreement. In addition, advice from harvesters, stewardship groups and
others will be gathered using existing processes.

Interim procedures will build on and expand the approach now used
to develop IFMP’s for salmon. The biological status of a CU or group of
CUs vulnerable to fisheries in an area will be reviewed.21 CUs in the Red
zone and those that could significantly limit fishing and other activities will
be identified as management priorities. The protection and restoration of
these CUs will be primary drivers for harvest, habitat and enhancement
planning. For these priority CUs, DFO will consult with First Nations and
then bring together the various interests from existing processes to provide
recommendations for protection and restoration. In collaboration with the
Department, these “response teams” will collate and consider information
from  all  sources  and  make  recommendations  using  a  five-step  planning
procedure  outlined  in  Appendix  2.  It  is  proposed  that  response  teams
would include representatives of First Nations and other local and regional
interests.  Their  recommendations  will  inform  regional  planning  and
program delivery and will be subject to consultation with First Nations as
required. In addition, during this interim period the Department will pay
careful  attention  to  identifying  and  responding  to  any  other  vulnerable
CUs so they do not decline in status.

Resource management recommendations from response teams will
be guided by precautionary approaches and will be consistent with the first
principle of this policy. Specifically, recommendations will be expected to
provide  an  acceptable  degree  of  confidence  that  these  priority  CUs  will
rebuild beyond the lower benchmark within a defined time frame. The
progress made towards achieving biological targets for priority CUs will be
reviewed annually (as described in Strategy 6) and adjustments to plans
made  as  appropriate.  This  interim  process  will  be  used  until  overall
responsibilities for the development of long term strategic plans for all CUs
can be assumed by a new planning structure (Action Step 4.2).

21The concept of planning units for Pacific salmon is described in the side bar "Linking CUs,
Fisheries and Watersheds for Planning Purposes" and is an organizational construct that will be
used to associate a group of CUs (CUs that are subject to common risk factors) with regional
fisheries.

Modern Treaties and
the Planning Process

The Nisga'a Final Agreement is the
first “modern” treaty entered into in
British Columbia and applies to the
management of salmon originating in
the Nass Area, as defined in the Final
Agreement. The Final Agreement
provides that the Nisga'a Nation has
the right to harvest chinook, chum,
coho, sockeye and pink salmon
originating in the Nass Area.
Under the Nisga'a Final
Agreement, representatives of the
federal government and the Nisga'a
Lisims Government participate on a
Joint Fisheries Management
Committee (JFMC) to facilitate
cooperative planning and conduct of
Nisga'a fisheries and enhancement
initiatives in the Nass Area. Various
responsibilities are assigned to the
JFMC, including providing advice
concerning escapement goals and
making recommendations to the
Minister and Nisga'a Lisims
Government in respect of other
conservation requirements and the
management of fish and aquatic plants.

Planning and implementation of
the Wild Salmon Policy, as it applies to
salmon originating in the Nass Area,
will be in accordance with the Nisga'a
Final Agreement.The JFMC will play a
key role in this work. Similarly, the
Department will act in accordance
with the provisions of the Yukon Final
Agreements when dealing with
salmon conservation pertaining to the
treaty settlement areas.

Action Step 4.2:
Design and implement a fully integrated strategic
planning process for salmon conservation.
The Department will consult with First Nations, Provincial and Territorial
governments,  communities,  and  stakeholders  to  design  an  effective
integrated  planning  process  that  respects  people’s  interests  in  Pacific
salmon, land and water uses, watersheds, fisheries, and marine areas. This
policy  does  not  dictate  that  process. Those  affected  need  to  be  directly
involved  in  the  process  design  and  implementation.  It  is  however
appropriate  to  describe  what  is  envisioned.  The  planning  process  will
ultimately consist of a new planning structure that will develop the plans
through an organized procedure.

A   Ne w   Pl a n n i n g   St r u c t u re

The  new  planning  structure  will  be  tasked  with  developing  long-term
strategic  plans  for  CUs  that  will  guide  fisheries  and  other  activities  in
specific  geographic  areas  affecting  the  CUs.  These  plans  will  need  to
determine  long  term  biological  targets  for  CUs  and  for  habitat  and
ecosystem status and address significant conservation concerns by ensuring
that all CUs will remain above their established lower benchmarks with an
acceptable degree of certainty. The development of these plans will need to
consider risks to wild salmon, as summarized in the status assessment of the
CU, and weigh the biological, social and economic impacts of fishing and
other activities (Principle 3).

Governments must operate in a manner consistent with the terms of
treaties negotiated with First Nations such as the Nisga’a Final Agreement.
Governments also have a legal obligation to consult with First Nations and
depending on the strength of the claim of Aboriginal rights or Aboriginal
title and the seriousness of the potential adverse effect of a decision on the
claimed rights or title, accommodate their interests where Governments
have  knowledge  of  the  potential  existence  of  Aboriginal  rights  or
Aboriginal title and are making decisions that might adversely affect these
rights  or  title.  Bilateral  consultations  between  Governments  and  First
Nations will be a foundation for the new integrated planning structure.  In
addition,  measures  taken  by  Federal,  Provincial  and  Territorial
governments  to  protect  First  Nation  salmon  fisheries  will  be  a  starting
point for the development of long term strategic plans for wild salmon.

The results of these First Nations consultations will then need to be
complemented  by  broader  local  and  eventually  region-wide  input.  It  is
suggested  that  local  planning  committees  for  sub-regions  need  to  be
established  that  can  bring  together  all  local  First  Nations  governments,
harvesters, community interests, local and regional government and other
stakeholders to link with more localized projects important to local areas
(like  Watershed-based  Fish  Sustainability  Planning  processes)  and
assemble,  assess  and  analyze  information  and  seek  local  consensus.  In
addition, the various interests involved in local planning will need to be

(cid:228)
28 Wild Salmon Policy

Key Attributes of an Effective Planning Process

An effective planning structure will require that the various interests involved build the mutual
trust necessary to work together toward their goals. Key attributes of the new structure
should be:

Inclusiveness
All parties that are affected by a planning outcome should have the opportunity to provide
input to the articulation of objectives, the identification of management options, and the
evaluation and selection of management alternatives. All parties should respect the others’
opinions and processes, and work towards consensus.

Transparency
Responsibility for final decision-making and linkages between the various parts of the planning
structure should be clearly described and agreed upon. Information considered in making
recommendations should be publicly available and communicated in a timely manner.
Recommendations and decisions should be carefully described and the reasons for them
clearly explained.

Effectiveness
Individual planning bodies within the planning structure should be small enough to provide for
focused discussion and dialogue but large enough to represent the full range of interests in the
matters under discussion.

Respect for Consultation Processes with First Nations
Governments have a legal obligation to consult with First Nations.  Any new planning process
will not compromise or undermine existing consultation processes with First Nations. Planning
processes will be in accordance with any applicable provisions of the Nisga’a Final Agreement,
the Yukon Final Agreements, and any other treaties entered into between the federal
government and First Nations.

Respect for Other Existing Processes
The results of other planning processes must also be respected, particularly those that deal
with legal requirements under SARA and other federal legislation and obligations under
international treaties.

Accountability
Participants in the planning process must be accountable to the people they represent by
defending the advice they have provided and to the process by defending the manner in which
decisions were made.

Wild Salmon Policy

29

brought  together  region-wide  to  confirm  overall
support  and  resolve  any  inconsistencies  between
local plans. The number and the geographic scale of
local area planning committees and the relationship
between First Nation consultation processes, local,
and  region-wide  committees  in  this  planning
structure  are  key  matters  to  be  resolved  through
consultation.

There will be two keys to success for a new
planning  structure.  First,  given  the  central
importance of First Nations salmon fisheries, there
will ideally need to be a high degree of support and
participation  by  First  Nations  at  all  levels  of  the
planning  structure.  The  role  and  the  terms  of
reference  for  new  multi-party  committees  within
the  structure  will  need  to  be  carefully  crafted  in
consultation with First Nations and other interests
to meet this need. The Department recognizes that
the provisions for participation of First Nations will
need  to  respect  their  individual  governance
structures.  Second,  there  will  need  to  be  a  high
degree  of  support  and  involvement  of  Provincial,
Territorial and local government at both local and
region-wide  levels  of  the  structure.  Bringing  the
constitutional and administrative mandates of these
other levels of government to manage land, water
and waste to the table will dramatically enhance and
improve  the  chances  for  success  of  strategic
planning efforts. This will require strong efforts by
the Department and others to build the necessary
political will and commitment for these other levels
of  government  to  support  and  participate  in  the
planning process.

A   Pl a n n i n g   Pro c e d u re

The development of strategic plans for CUs should
follow a formal and open procedure that will result
in informed decision-making.

This policy presents a five-step procedure for
development of the strategic plans that breaks down
decision-making  into  a  logical  and  manageable
sequence. This procedure is detailed in Appendix 2.
It  seeks  to  engage  the  various  interests  in  Pacific
salmon throughout the development of the plans –
from  the  establishment  of  planning  priorities
through  to  the  evaluation  and  selection  of  the

preferred management alternative. This will explicitly
encourage the pursuit of creative solutions and help
to focus planning discussions on the relevant issues
and considerations throughout the development of
plans. This is intended to build consensus on the
most  appropriate  management  approach  and
facilitate public understanding of final management
decisions.

The  Minister  of  Fisheries  and  Oceans  is
accountable  to  Parliament  for  the  conservation  of
fisheries  resources.  Accordingly,  strategic  plans  for
salmon  conservation  and  sustainable  use  will  be
subject to final approval by the Minister of Fisheries
and  Oceans.  The  Minister  may  reject  plans  or
elements of plans because they do not adequately
conserve wild salmon. Alternatively, in exceptional
circumstances,  where  recommended  management
actions  are  assessed  to  be  ineffective,  or  the  social
and economic costs will be extreme, the Minister of
Fisheries and Oceans may decide to limit the extent
of active measures undertaken. The new planning
process described above is expected to minimize the
need for such decisions, but this possibility should
be recognized.  The rationale for such decisions will
be  clearly  explained.  In  addition,  any  cumulative
effect of these decisions will be closely monitored.

30 Wild Salmon Policy

Enhancement and Wild Salmon

Enhancement of Pacific salmon has been largely delivered through the Salmonid Enhancement
Program (SEP). SEP was launched in 1977 to augment production for harvest through a
combination of natural and artificial enhancement techniques. The program was also designed
to involve the public, raise awareness of the salmon resource, and generate jobs and economic
development in coastal and First Nations communities. Its focus has since broadened to
encompass rebuilding depleted stocks for conservation purposes with a greater emphasis on
the integration of harvest and habitat management with stock rebuilding. The program uses a
rebuilding strategy whereby a portion of the enhanced fish spawn naturally in the waters from
which they originated in order to rebuild or maintain the population. This means that in river
systems where there is a hatchery or spawning channel, fish spawning naturally in the river may
consist of both wild and enhanced salmon. The probability of genetic changes to wild salmon is
controlled by the use of native populations for broodstock and broodstock collection and
spawning guidelines.

Enhancement activities have contributed a significant proportion of the salmon produced
in British Columbia and the Yukon. The proportion varies by species, geographic area, and year,
but since the 1980s, 10 to 20 per cent of the BC commercial catch has originated from SEP.
Moreover, some recreational fisheries are dependent on enhanced salmon, such as mark-
selective fisheries on coho salmon, and various freshwater fisheries. As part of integrated
strategic plans, enhancement will continue to be used as a means of addressing social and
biological objectives through the rebuilding of populations with an unacceptable chance of
extirpation by providing harvest opportunities and fishery benefits.

SEP has developed many useful tools for producing and restoring Pacific salmon, and it

enjoys substantial public support. Evaluations undertaken for enhancement also provide
important data used for the assessment and management of wild salmon. However,
enhancement, particularly hatcheries, poses some acknowledged risks to wild salmon. Wild
populations harvested with more productive enhanced populations may be overexploited.
Hatchery practices may alter genetic diversity. Wild salmon may have to compete with
enhanced salmon for food and space in the marine and freshwater environments. SEP employs
practices to minimize these risks including:

• guidelines to manage spawning and hatchery practices to maintain genetic diversity and

minimize impacts on resident freshwater juveniles

• review and licencing of all fish movements under Section 55/56 of the Fishery (General)

Regulations

• annual planning processes that link

– hatchery production with planning of major fisheries targeting enhanced populations

– hatchery assessment with stock assessment planning frameworks to ensure that

enhanced indicator populations can be effectively used for both the assessment of
enhancement programs and for wild salmon assessment and management

Wild Salmon Policy

31

Aquaculture

Over the past decade, production from salmon aquaculture has expanded threefold, and the
value of farmed salmon now exceeds that from commercial salmon fisheries. The industry’s
development has provided employment and income in coastal communities, where economic
opportunities are often limited. This expansion has not been without controversy.

Jurisdiction for the regulation of aquaculture is shared between the Federal and
Provincial governments. The provision of aquatic land tenures and the licencing of aquaculture
operations in BC is the responsibility of the Provincial government.  The Department’s role, as
the lead federal agency for aquaculture, is to manage aquaculture so that it is environmentally
sustainable, socially responsible, and economically viable. In 2002 the Department released the
Aquaculture Policy Framework (APF)22 to guide the Department’s actions with respect to
aquaculture. The first principle of the APF directs the Department to support aquaculture
development in a manner consistent with its commitments to ecosystem-based and integrated
management, as set out in Departmental legislation, regulations and policies. This principle
reflects the Department’s mandate for the conservation of marine resources.

 It is recognized that aquaculture operations, as with other human activities, pose risks to

the natural environment. These potenial impacts to wild salmon include: the chance of disease
and parasite transfer, competition and genetic effects of escapes, and physical disturbances in
near-shore environments. Risks are addressed through mitigation measures such as Fish Health
Management Plans, improved cage structures and proper farm siting.

All fish farm sites must undergo a review for potential habitat effects under Section 35 of

the Fisheries Act. The review includes evaluation of information on the size of the farm
combined with specific features of the site such as benthic habitat and water currents and is
intended to minimize the effects on important habitat such as eelgrass beds. Subsequent
monitoring is carried out in conjunction with Provincial agencies.

The vast majority of marine fish farm sites also require, through either a Fisheries Act

authorization or Navigable Waters Act permit, a screening for a broad range of environmental
effects under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA). The CEAA screening examines
the potential environmental effects of the project, judges the effectiveness of mitigation
measures and assesses any residual impacts on the environment. A screening for a fish farm site
encompasses all the potential effects on the natural environment, including the impacts of
disease and parasite transfers, escapes, waste discharges and impacts to wildlife. Impacts which
are judged to be significant must be addressed through mitigation measures, set out in required
management plans and through adherence to Provincial regulations for fish health, escape
prevention, sea lice monitoring and waste discharge. The CEAA screening also considers the
cumulative effects of other projects in the same area and only those projects that are unlikely
to cause significant adverse environmental effects (post mitigation) are allowed to proceed.
The goal, principles, and objectives of the Wild Salmon Policy will guide the regulatory
actions of the Department. Aquaculture operations will be regulated in a manner consistent
with other human activities that may adversely affect salmon or their habitat and DFO will
continue to invest in research to improve our understanding and management of this industry.

WSP Implications:
Science, Including
Stock Assessment

• Scientific programs will be

refocused to complement changes
to fisheries management, the
immediate need being identification
and documentation of
Conservation Units and
benchmarks for each Pacific salmon
species.

• Stock assessment programs will
build on existing monitoring
programs to assess wild salmon at
appropriate geographic scales.

• Refocused programs will emphasize

assessing the status of CUs,
understanding changes to
productivity and distribution, and
developing risk assessment and
management tools to guide
decision-making.

• DFO scientists will work with
habitat and fishery managers to
develop approaches to integrate
ecosystem considerations into
assessment and management.

• Co-management will be promoted

with First Nations, and more
partnerships will be necessary with
public and private groups to collect
required data, given the expanded
monitoring needs and constraints
on available funding.

A  strategic  plan  gives  a  longer-term  context  for  annual  operational  and
business planning cycles. The strategic plan described in Strategy 4 will establish
overall objectives and the various approaches that will be followed to achieve
them. It will be left to annual operating plans to detail the specific short-term
actions  that  actually  implement  the  long-term  strategy.  Annual  plans  will
identify the particular activities to be undertaken, the short-term operational
targets for these activities, and the linkages to longer-term goals and objectives.

Action Step 5.1.
Assess the status of Conservation Units and populations
Under this policy, DFO will assume a leadership role in partnerships to
develop monitoring programs and assessments of wild salmon. Assessment
will include field activities, which will build on existing programs as much
as possible, and detailed stock assessments, which will identify the reasons
for  changes  in  status.  Annual  priorities  for  detailed  assessments  will  be
determined through PSARC, and documents prepared by Departmental
staff  and  technical  experts  in  other  organizations  involved  with  a  CU,
particularly the First Nations. The assessment of CUs will be staged over
time, cost-effectively using a range of approaches. CU status will influence
the frequency and detailed assessments but monitoring of abundance and
distribution of salmon in CUs must be an annual commitment to protect
the information basis for all decisions.

Stock assessment work plans describing the assessment plan for each
CU and related activities (e.g., research or habitat activities) will be updated
annually for each region (e.g., North Coast, Yukon). They will be reported
as part of a database that describes for each region major risk factors and
changes to these factors, assessment strategies within the region, resource
management  objectives,  enhancement  activities,  and  benchmarks.  DFO
will also commit to providing an open database of information on catch
and spawning escapement, with links to the habitat integrated data system,
so that threats or impacts can be identified and monitored.

Action Step 5.2.
Plan and conduct annual fisheries
The  specific  annual  fisheries  management  measures  required  by  the
management  strategies  selected  under  Strategy  4  will  be  identified  and
documented in annual Integrated Fishery Management Plans. These plans
will  include  arrangements  for  food,  social  and  ceremonial  and  treaty
fisheries  by  First  Nations  and  selective  harvesting  and  other  regulatory
measures that will be put in place, such as bag and possession limits and
anticipated open and close times.

Another  key  element  of  annual  fisheries  planning  will  be  the
development of explicit agreed-upon rules for in-season decision-making.

WSP Implications:
Harvest Management

• Harvest management will focus on

the conservation of CUs.

• The practical implications of this
change for harvest management
will depend greatly on the extent
to which the CUs identified under
this policy differ from the salmon
runs currently targeted by the
different fisheries.This, in turn, will
vary among salmon species.

• There will likely be relatively few
impacts on the management of
chum and pink salmon, as these
fisheries currently target smaller
population components than may
be identified as CUs.

• More substantial impacts can be
expected for the management of
coho and chinook salmon, as the
number of CUs will likely increase
marginally from present
management aggregates.

• Impacts on sockeye management
will be significant, since these
fisheries target runs that often
encompass numerous CUs.

• The WSP will not preclude fisheries
operating on population aggregates
that include numerous CUs, but
increased attention to all of the
units within the aggregate will likely
require significant changes to
current management practices.

survival  and  the  imprecision  of  in-season  management  cannot  be
eliminated, but they can be better accounted for.  Management plans will
incorporate  estimates  of  uncertainty  and  provide  an  adequate  degree  of
confidence  that  management  objectives  will  be  met.  The  management
responses to be taken in different circumstances will be more transparently
identified  and  documented  in  advance  of  the  fishing  season.  Important
input on these decision rules will be sought from First Nations and the
Integrated Salmon Harvest Planning Committee.

Action Step 5.3.
Plan and implement annual habitat management activities
Habitat  program  work  will  shift  from  being  largely  reactive,  to  being
planned  and  strategically  directed  in  order  to  protect  habitat  and  to
implement  management  measures  that  meet  the  long  term  objectives
specified by Strategic Plans (Strategy 4).

Strategy  two  will  identify  habitats  that  underpin  achievement  of
overall objectives for Conservation Units. These will include habitats that
are intact and require protection or habitats that are degraded and require
restoration  or  rehabilitation.  Annual  workplans  will  specify  priorities  for
habitat rehabilitation or restoration work that will be undertaken by DFO
or by DFO in partnership with others, and investigative work that may be
undertaken to fill knowledge gaps. Plans will also recognize the need for
protection of the key habitats identified in Strategy 2 using tools appropriate
to the circumstances. Planning for restoration and habitat improvement will
incorporate  projects  conducted  by  First  Nations,  volunteers  and
stakeholders and make use of more accessible data from a variety of sources.
On an annual basis, a report on regulatory functions related to key
habitats and restoration and rehabilitation works will be prepared.  Habitat
assessment and monitoring will feed back into the Habitat Management
Program to evaluate measures for habitat protection and compliance, and
to  guide  future  program  improvements. This  new  strategic  approach  to
program delivery should ensure that fish habitat protection objectives are
better integrated with fish management objectives at the CU level, leading
to improved habitat protection.

Action Step 5.4.
Plan and implement annual enhancement activities
The long-term objectives for enhancement projects will be set as part of a
planning  or  recovery  process  for  a  Conservation  Unit.  Enhancement
programs  will  last  more  than  a  year,  but  annual  production  targets  and
strategies  will  be  documented  in  IFMP’s  and  will  be  consistent  with
objectives for CUs. Adult salmon production will be assessed for adherence
to  the  rebuilding  schedule  and  enhancement  guidelines  and  practices.
Priority  projects  will  target  CUs  in  the  Red  or  Amber  zone,  where
enhancement has been identified as a contributor to rebuilding. Secondary
priority will be given to CUs where enhancement has been identified in
planning processes as a means to maintain or develop fisheries.

WSP Implications:
Habitat Management

• The Habitat Management Program

will change to better link
watershed protection and
stewardship initiatives with fish
production objectives by integrating
habitat monitoring, assessment, and
program planning at the CU scale.

• Habitat condition will be assessed

through the development of
indicators and benchmarks, and
monitoring will be conducted to
identify changes in habitat status
over time and assess the
effectiveness of regulatory
interventions.

• An integrated data system for the
collection and dissemination of
information on fish habitat status
will be supported through
improved access between existing
systems.

• These new approaches will

complement existing efforts to
modernize the national Habitat
Management Program, aimed at
moving from a focus on single
regulatory strategy to a more
balanced approach with greater
emphasis on program planning,
stewardship, and monitoring the
success of habitat management in
sustaining fish production.

• If specific Conservation Units of
wild salmon are threatened by
development proposals or other
human activities, corrective actions
will be taken under Section 35 (fish
habitat) of the Fisheries Act, or
longer-term solutions will be
pursued as part of integrated
planning processes.

A performance review determines what is and is not working to encourage
continuous improvement over time. Performance review under the Wild
Salmon Policy will borrow heavily from procedures that are being adopted
more  generally  in  fisheries  management  planning  throughout  Canada.
These  procedures  involve  two  levels  of  evaluation  that  can  provide
comprehensive guidance on changes required over time. Action Step 6.1
provides annual feedback on the implementation of measures taken as part
of  annual  plans  specified  for  fisheries,  habitat,  enhancement  and
assessment. Further, it evaluates whether adequate progress is being made
to achieve the objectives defined in the strategic plan for the CU.  Action
Step 6.2 provides for periodic reviews of the overall success of the WSP in
meeting its goal and objectives.

Action Step 6.1
Conduct post-season review of annual workplans
The  Department  in  consultation  with  First  Nations  and  others  will
conduct annual post-season reviews of work plan implementation for stock
assessment,  fishing,  habitat,  and  enhancement  that  will  provide  the
following:

• Evaluation  of  annual  plan  implementation.  For  example,  if  an
annual fishing plan calls for a substantial reduction in fishing time,
or an annual enhancement work plan calls for certain fry release levels
in a given year, it is important to know whether these events took place.
• Evaluation  of  annual  operational  targets.  For  example,  the
operational  targets  may  be  exploitation  rates  in  certain  fisheries
and  lineal  metres  of  habitat  rehabilitation,  both  intended  to
increase  the  number  of  spawners.  An  evaluation  will  consider
whether  annual  operational  targets  were  achieved  and  whether
they were effective in meeting the intent of the Strategic Plan.

• Recommendations for adjustments for the next season.

Action Step 6.2.
Conduct regular reviews of the success of the WSP
An independent review of the success of the WSP in achieving its broad
goals and objectives will be conducted within 5 years of its adoption. On
the basis of the review, the implementation of the policy will be revised to
address  shortcomings that may be reducing its effectiveness.

WSP Implications:
Species at Risk

• The WSP will facilitate taking

management actions in advance of
biological listing under COSEWIC
and legal listing under the Species at
Risk Act.

• This will directly contribute to
meeting DFO’s legal obligations
under SARA, by helping to prevent
aquatic species from being
extirpated or becoming extinct.

• Proactive responses in advance of
listing will help to manage and
reduce any adverse social and
economic impacts that might arise
from conservation actions required
under a SARA listing.

“ M a k i n g   i t   a l l   Wo r k”

The  adoption  of  a  wild  salmon  policy  is  an  important,  long-awaited
objective, but not an end in itself. Once it is adopted, attention must shift
to implementation. The WSP requires acceptance of new ways of doing
business and introduces a number of new program obligations. To ensure
its commitments are met, an implementation plan will be prepared after
the  policy’s  finalization. This  plan  will  stipulate  what  tasks  are  required,
how  they  will  be  performed,  and  when  they  will  be  completed.  On
completion,  the  plan  will  constitute  the  Department’s  commitment  to
meeting its responsibilities for salmon conservation.

The six strategies proposed in the WSP represent a set of mutually
dependent  activities  that  must  work  together  for  the  policy’s  goal  and
objectives  to  be  achieved.  Since  the  individual  strategies  are  not
autonomous, successful implementation of each one of them is necessary
to ensure the overall success of salmon resource management.

This new approach to salmon conservation is complex, and the pace
and effectiveness of implementation will be influenced by two key factors.
First,  implementation  must  be  accomplished  within  DFO’s  existing
resource capability and will be phased in over time. Second, it will depend
on  the  effectiveness  of  our  sharing  of  responsibilities  with  First  Nations
Governments, volunteers, stakeholders and other Governments.

Full implementation will not be achieved overnight. Establishing the
management and consultation process, and allowing it to mature, will take
time. The  completion  of  scientific  work  to  define  Conservation  Units,

WSP Implications:
Aquaculture

• Aquaculture operations will be

regulated in a manner consistent
with other human activities that
may adversely affect salmon or
their habitat.

• If specific Conservation Units of
wild salmon are threatened by
aquaculture operations, corrective
actions will be taken under the
Fisheries Act, or longer-term
solutions will be pursued as part of
an integrated planning process.

WSP Implications:
Salmonid Enhancement
Program

• The enhancement program will

continue to evolve towards greater
emphasis on community
stewardship, habitat restoration, and
rebuilding of priority CUs.

• Enhancement may be used to

provide harvest opportunities and
fishery benefits as part of an
integrated strategic plan.

• The risks of hatchery production
to wild salmon will be assessed
through the development of a
biological risk assessment
framework.

establish benchmarks, and design new assessment systems will depend on
the  availability  of  data  and  scientific  capacity.  In  addition,  the  policy
introduces  new  challenges  for  the  conduct  of  ongoing  programs,  and
ultimate success depends on effective delivery of the Department’s research,
enforcement, and Aboriginal programs. All of these activities, ongoing and
new,  must  be  accomplished  within  the  envelope  of  available  funding.
Accordingly, it must be emphasized that complete implementation will not
be achieved instantaneously, but will be phased in gradually.

There is a second requirement for successful policy implementation.
The  Department  must  adopt  better  partnerships  with  First  Nations
Governments,  volunteers,  stakeholders  and  other  levels  of  Government
and share responsibility and accountability for program delivery. It is clear
that  DFO  cannot  and  should  not  attempt  to  do  it  all.  No  matter  how
strong our commitment to implementing the WSP, success will demand
better  collaboration  with  all  of  the  groups  and  individuals  having  an
interest in wild Pacific salmon. All have important roles to play in achieving
sustainable management of wild salmon and their habitat. These groups
monitor  and  report  catches,  protect  and  restore  habitat,  and  carry  out
biological  assessment  work.  Too  often,  this  work  is  not  integrated
effectively with Departmental activities, which can diminish its value or
simply result in wasted effort and funds. More collaboration is required to
develop data standards, agree on methodologies, and share responsibility if
we are to get the full benefit from the financial and human resources that
are  collectively  dedicated  to  salmon  stewardship.  Improved  cooperation
with partners will be an important ingredient for future success. The more
transparent process for decision-making underlying this policy will ensure
that we are better equipped to achieve this important outcome.

Wild Salmon Policy

C O N C L U S I O N

The Wild Salmon Policy will transform our approach to managing Pacific
salmon, their habitat, and dependent ecosystems. It is intended to foster a
more robust resource that supports sustainable fisheries and recognizes the
intrinsic  value  of  salmon  to  society  and  to  ecosystem  functioning.  Key
elements of the policy recognize that:

1. Protection of the genetic and geographic diversity of salmon is a
prerequisite to their future evolutionary adaptation and long-term
well-being.

2. Habitat requires effective protection and rehabilitation if salmon

are to prosper.

3. Ecosystem  integrity  needs  to  be  considered  in  management
decision-making  to  foster  the  conservation  of  salmon  in  an
increasingly uncertain future.

4. Management must be based on good scientific information and

consider biological, social, and economic consequences.

5. Decisions  have  to  be  made  using  open  and  accountable  public

processes so that they reflect society’s values.

The  goal,  objectives,  principles,  and  strategies  that  underpin  the
WSP represent a new way of doing business. Moving ahead will require a
redirection  of  the  Department’s  energy  and  resources,  along  with  a
commitment  to  embrace  and  advance  new  practices.  Success  will  also
require the cooperation of all who have an interest in the conservation of
Pacific  salmon.  We  are  confident  that  making  these  changes  is  a  wise
investment that will yield a brighter future for salmon and the Canadians
who enjoy them.

38 Wild Salmon Policy

G LO S S A RY

Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge (ATK). Includes, but is not limited to, the knowledge Aboriginal peoples have
accumulated about wildlife species and their environment. Much of this knowledge has accumulated over many
generations.

Aquaculture. The farming of aquatic organisms in the marine environment or freshwater.

Biodiversity or biological diversity. The full range of variety and variability within and among living organisms and
the ecological complexes in which they occur; and encompasses diversity at the ecosystem, community, species,
and genetic levels and the interaction of these components.

Broodstock. Mature salmon from which milt and roe are extracted to produce the next generation of cultivated fish.

Conservation. The protection, maintenance, and rehabilitation of genetic diversity, species, and ecosystems to
sustain biodiversity and the continuance of evolutionary and natural production processes.23

Conservation Unit (CU). A group of wild salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if extirpated, is very
unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable timeframe.

Deme. A group of salmon at a persistent spawning site or within a stream comprised of individuals that are likely
to breed with each other (i.e., well mixed). A single population may include more than one deme.

Ecosystem. A community of organisms and their physical environment interacting as an ecological unit.

Enhancement. The application of biological and technical knowledge and capabilities to increase the productivity
of fish stocks. It may be achieved by altering habitat attributes (e.g., habitat restoration) or by using fish culture
techniques (e.g., hatcheries, spawning channels). In the context of this policy, only salmon originating from
hatcheries and managed spawning channels will be considered enhanced.

Escapement. The number of mature salmon that pass through (or escape) fisheries and return to fresh water to
spawn.

Extirpation. The local extinction of a species.

Fish habitat. Spawning grounds and nursery, rearing, food supply, and migration areas on which fish depend
directly or indirectly to carry out their life processes.

Fry. Salmon that have emerged from gravel, completed yolk absorption, remained in freshwater streams, and are
less than a few months old.

Genetic diversity. The variation at the level of individual genes, and provides a mechanism for populations to
adapt to their ever-changing environment. It refers to the differences in genetic make-up between distinct species
and to genetic variations within a single species.

23For further details see Shuter et al. (1997), “Reply: Toward a definition of conservation principles for fisheries management;” Grumbine (1994), “What is
ecosystem management?;” Mangel et al. (1996), “Conservation of wild living resources;” and Olver et al. (1995), “Toward a definition of conservation
principles for fisheries management.”

Wild Salmon Policy

39

Geographic diversity. Spatial variability observed within a species. This variation may have a genetic basis and/or
may reflect habitat and developmental differences expressed by the species.

Habitat restoration. The treatment or cleanup of fish habitat that has been altered, disrupted, or degraded for the
purpose of increasing its capability to sustain fish production.

Indicator system (IS). Comprised of fish from one or more persistent spawning locations or populations (perhaps
enhanced) that are assumed to be representative of some aspect of a Conservation Unit. An IS may be an index
site or stream selected to detect annual changes in abundance and/or survival, or an extensive site or stream
selected to monitor species distribution and general habitat status. The status of the surrounding CU is inferred,
in part, by comparing measures of abundance gathered by monitoring the IS to benchmarks.

Integrated resource management (IRM). Can be defined as a way of using and managing the environment and
natural resources to achieve sustainable development. Using an IRM approach means that environmental, social,
and economic issues are considered, while finding ways for all uses to exist together with less conflict.

Managed spawning channels. Spawning channels where the entry of spawners and spawning density is controlled.

Maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The largest catch (yield) that can be taken on average from a population under
existing environmental conditions. Catch will vary annually due to variation  in a populations survival rate.

Pacific salmon. Salmon of the Pacific Ocean regions, of which there are currently eleven species recognized in the
Genus Oncorhynchus. The five species addressed in this policy are sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka), pink (O. gorbuscha),
chum  (O.  keta),  coho  (O.  kisutch)  and  chinook  (O.  tshawytscha).  Also  in  BC  are  steelhead  (O.  mykiss)  and
cutthroat trout (O. clarki). The remaining species include the masu (Asian distribution, O. masou), Mexican
golden trout (O. chrysogaster), apache trout (O. apache), and gila trout (O. gilae). These latter three species have
limited distributions in the western U.S. and northern Mexico.

Population. A group of interbreeding organisms that is relatively isolated (i.e. demographically uncoupled) from
other such groups and is likely adapted to the local habitat.

Precautionary approach. When used in an advisory context in support of decision-making by the Government of
Canada, this term conveys the sense that the advice is provided in situations of high scientific uncertainty. It is
intended to promote actions that would result in a low probability of harm that is serious or difficult to reverse.

Productive  capacity. The  maximum  natural  capability  of  habitats  to  produce  healthy  fish,  safe  for  human
consumption, or to support or produce aquatic organisms on which fish depend.

Resource  management. Departmental  actions,  policies  and  programs  affecting  wild  Pacific  salmon  directly  or
indirectly through their habitats and ecosystems.

Riparian zone and functions. The area of vegetation near streams is known as the riparian zone. Riparian function
includes the interaction of hydrologic, geomorphic, and biotic processes within the riparian environment that
determine the character of the riparian zone and the influences exerted on the adjacent aquatic and terrestrial
environments (e.g., temperature controls, shading, large woody debris).

Salmonid. A group of fish that includes salmon, trout, and char, belonging to the taxonomic Family Salmonidae.

40 Wild Salmon Policy

Selective harvesting. A conservation-based management approach that allows for the harvest of surplus target
species or Conservation Units while aiming to minimize or avoid the harvest of species or stocks of conservation
concern, or to release bycatch unharmed.

Smolt. A juvenile salmon that has completed rearing in freshwater and migrates into the marine environment.
A smolt becomes physiologically capable of balancing salt and water in the estuary and ocean waters. Smolts vary
in size and age depending on the species of salmon.

Species. The fundamental category of taxonomic classification consisting of organisms grouped by virtue of their
common attributes and capable of interbreeding. A taxonomic species is equivalent to the term “species” but the
phrase may be used to indicate the collective species throughout its distribution.

Stewardship. Acting responsibly to conserve fish and their habitat for present and future generations.

Stock assessment. The use of various statistical and mathematical calculations to make quantitative predictions
about the reactions of fish populations to alternative management choices.

Straying. The migration of a mature salmon into a stream other than that in which it was born (i.e., its “home”
stream).  Straying  is  not  equivalent  to  gene  flow  (the  exchange  of  genetic  material)  unless  the  straying  fish
successfully reproduces in the receiving stream.

Sustainable Development. Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of
future generations to meet their own needs.24

Sustainable Use and Benefit. The use of resources in a way and at a rate that does not lead to their long-term
decline, thereby maintaining the potential for future generations to meet their needs and aspirations. Sustainable
use refers to consumptive uses of biological resources.25 Sustainable benefits, on the other hand, derive from a
broader range of consumptive and non-consumptive resource uses.

Watershed-based Fish Sustainability Planning (WFSP). A new approach to the management of fish stocks and fish
habitat in British Columbia. Its overall goal is to ensure effective long-term conservation of fish and fish habitat –
including spawning grounds and nursery, rearing, food supply, and migration areas on which fish depend directly
or indirectly. WFSP is based on a standard planning sequence that can be applied to regions and watersheds
across the province.26

Wild salmon. Salmon are considered “wild” if they have spent their entire life cycle in the wild and originate from
parents that were also produced by natural spawning and continuously lived in the wild.

DFO exercises the following mandate with respect to fisheries and other responsibilities:

“Fisheries and Oceans Canada is responsible for policies and programs in support of Canada's economic, ecological
and scientific interests in oceans and inland waters; for the conservation and sustainable utilization of Canada's fisheries
resources in marine and inland waters; for leading and facilitating federal policies and program on oceans; and for safe
effective and environmentally sound marine services responsive to the needs of Canadians in a global economy.” 27

This appendix outlines some of the key legislation, national and international agreements, and programs and
policies with particular implications for the conservation and management of Pacific salmon.

Legislation

The Fisheries Act is the primary legislative basis for fisheries management in Canada. It authorizes the Minister
of Fisheries and Oceans to make decisions about the conservation of fisheries resources and habitat, to establish
and enforce standards for conservation, and to determine access to and allocation of the resource. Sections 35
(prohibiting the harmful alternation, disruption, and destruction, or HADD, of fish habitat) and 36 (prohibiting
the deposit of deleterious substances into waters frequented by fish) confer strong powers to protect fish habitat.
The  Fisheries  Development  Act of 1985 further authorizes the Minister to undertake projects and develop
partnerships to improve or develop commercial fisheries.

The  Canadian  Environmental  Assessment  Act  (CEAA)  came  into  force  in  1995  and  was  updated
through  amendments  in  November  2003.  Federal  agencies  must  conduct  environmental  assessments  of
development  proposals  requiring  decisions  under  federal  legislation  (e.g.,  decisions  under  section  35  of  the
Fisheries Act or prior to issuing permits under the Navigable Waters Protection Act or the National Energy Board
Act). The CEAA process requires the advice of relevant federal agencies to assess significant environmental effects
in the planning of a project. Smaller and routine projects typically undergo a “screening” assessment, while larger
and environmentally sensitive projects undergo a more intensive "comprehensive study".

In 1997, the Ocean’s  Act extended the Department’s role in managing the use of marine resources and
habitats.  It  called  for  the  development  of  a  national  oceans  management  strategy  guided  by  the  principles  of
sustainable  development,  integrated  management  and  an  ecosystem  perspective.  Integrated  management  is  a
collaborative approach to decision-making that aims to balance the various interests in the marine and coastal
environment, while incorporating conservation requirements. Ecosystem-based fisheries management considers the
interactions between species and their environment, as well as the impact of fishing on the ecosystem. Canada’s
Oceans Strategy 28 released in 2002 defines an oceans-centred planning framework that combines these principles.
The Species at Risk Act (SARA) was proclaimed in June 2003, fulfilling a key national commitment under
the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (see below). As one of two federal departments charged
with SARA’s implementation, DFO is responsible for protecting aquatic species at risk and their habitat. This
responsibility includes the legal requirements to implement automatic prohibitions, develop recovery and action
plans, plan and implement critical habitat protection, and conduct consultations within specified timelines.

Guidance from the Courts Regarding Aboriginal Fishing Issues

DFO seeks to manage fisheries, including Aboriginal fisheries, in a manner consistent with R. v. Sparrow and
subsequent decisions of the courts.

42 Wild Salmon Policy

As the Supreme Court of Canada stated in its 1996 decision in R. v. Van der Peet, an Aboriginal right is a
practice, custom or tradition that was integral to the distinctive culture of an Aboriginal group at the time of contact
between that group and Europeans.  Accordingly, Aboriginal rights, by their very nature, have existed for a very long
time. Rights under “historic treaties”, such as the Douglas Treaties, have also existed for a very long time in Canada.
The only "modern treaty" in BC is the Nisga’a Final Agreement that applies to part of the northwestern part of BC.
Other modern treaties are under negotiation in the British Columbia Treaty Commission process.

Although Aboriginal and treaty rights have existed in Canada for a very long time, those rights were not
protected by the Constitution of Canada until 1982.  In that year, section 35 was added to the Constitution.
Section 35 states that existing Aboriginal and treaty rights are “recognized and affirmed”.

Starting with its 1990 decision in R. v. Sparrow, the Supreme Court of Canada has described a framework for
the analysis of Aboriginal and treaty rights issues. The first step in the analysis is to determine whether an Aboriginal
or treaty right can be established. If a right is established, the next step is to determine whether it has been infringed.
If the right has been infringed, the court will consider whether the infringement can be justified.  Courts continue to
emphasize that analysis of Aboriginal and treaty rights issues must be done on a case by case basis.

With respect to the establishment of Aboriginal rights, the most important decision to date is the 1996
decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Van der Peet. The Court held in that decision that an Aboriginal
right is a practice, custom or tradition that was integral to the distinctive culture of an Aboriginal group claiming
the right at the time of contact between that group and Europeans. In its 1997 decision in Delgamuukw v. BC,
the Supreme Court of Canada clarified that Aboriginal title, i.e., a right of exclusive use and occupation, is a type
of Aboriginal right and set out the test for establishing Aboriginal title.

In its decision in R. v. Sparrow, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the following factors should be
considered in assessing whether or not a limitation (such as an action or decision) infringes an Aboriginal or
treaty right:

• Does the limitation impose “undue hardship”?
• Is the limitation unreasonable?
• Does the limitation deny the holder of the right the “preferred means” of exercising the right?

If an Aboriginal group establishes a right, and that it has been infringed, the onus shifts to the Crown to
justify the infringement. In R. v. Sparrow, the Supreme Court of Canada stated that “federal power must be
reconciled with federal duty and the best way to achieve that reconciliation is to demand the justification of any
government regulation that infringes upon or denies aboriginal rights”.

With respect to justifying infringements of rights to fish for food, social and ceremonial purposes, the

Supreme Court of Canada held in R. v. Sparrow that the following factors should be considered:

1. Is there a “valid legislative objective” (e.g., conservation)?
2. Has the honour of the Crown been upheld?

– Priority after conservation?
– Adequate consultation?
– As little infringement as possible?
– Fair compensation (in a “situation of expropriation”)?

In its decision in R. v. Sparrow, the Supreme Court of Canada described a “valid legislative objective” as
follows: “An objective aimed at preserving s. 35(1) rights by conserving and managing a natural resource, for
example, would be valid. Also valid would be objectives purporting to prevent the exercise of s. 35(1) rights that
would cause harm to the general populace or to aboriginal peoples themselves, or other objectives found to be
compelling and substantial.” In its 1996 decision in R. v. Nikal, the Court acknowledged that “conservation” can
include measures to reasonably increase fish stocks.

In its 1995 decisions in R. v. Jack, John and John, R. v. Sampson and Elliot, and R. v. Little (sometimes referred
to as the “interception cases”), the BC Court of Appeal considered situations in which fish were harvested in mixed

Wild Salmon Policy

43

stock interception fisheries while Aboriginal fisheries in terminal areas were limited.  In its decision in R. v. Sampson
and Elliot, the Court provided the following guidance: “We do not suggest that the DFO should prohibit all
commercial and recreational fishing in the area of the interception fishery in Johnstone Strait. However, it is the
responsibility of the DFO to implement a system which will conform to the priorities set forth in Sparrow.”

In all of the decisions in which the issue of priority has been considered, courts have carefully assessed the
often complex facts relating to the how the Aboriginal, commercial and recreational fisheries were managed in
the circumstances. It is clear that consideration of the issue of priority will always involve a detailed “case by case”
analysis of the relevant facts.

With respect to consultation issues, significant guidance was provided by the Supreme Court of Canada in
late 2004 in its decision in Haida v. BC.  In that decision, the Court ruled that the Crown has a legal duty to consult
with First Nations and, depending on the strength of the claim of Aboriginal rights or Aboriginal title and the
seriousness of the potential adverse effect of a decision on the claimed rights or title, accommodate their interests
when the Crown has knowledge of the potential existence of an Aboriginal right or Aboriginal title and is making
decisions that might adversely affect the right or title. The Court held that scope of the duty will vary depending
on the circumstances, including the strength of a First Nation’s claim respecting the Aboriginal right or Aboriginal
title and the potential impact of the government’s decision on the claimed right or title. It is significant that, in its
decision  in  Haida  v.  BC,  the  Supreme  Court  of  Canada  held  that  the  Crown’s  legal  duty  to  consult  with  an
Aboriginal group can arise even before the group establishes any Aboriginal rights or Aboriginal title.

Agreements

In 1985, Canada and the United States signed the Pacific Salmon Treaty requiring the conduct of fisheries so
as to provide for optimum production and equitable exploitation of salmon stocks. Under the Treaty, each party
is to receive benefits equivalent to the production of salmon originating in its waters, and each is to avoid undue
disruption to the other’s fisheries. Bilateral agreements must be periodically developed to implement the Treaty’s
principles for long-term conservation and harvest sharing. In addition, the Pacific Salmon Commission was
established to advise both countries on the implementation of Treaty provisions.

Canada was the first industrialized nation to ratify the UN Convention on Biological Diversity signed
by more than 150 countries at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The Convention has three main goals:
(1)  the  conservation  of  biodiversity;  (2)  sustainable  use  of  the  components  of  biodiversity;  and  (3)  fair  and
equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the commercial and other use of genetic resources. In terms of
defining  at  what  level  biodiversity  should  be  conserved,  it  advocates  the  conservation  of  genes,  species  and
ecosystems, without providing guidance on which one should receive priority.

In 1996, the federal, Provincial and Territorial governments signed the Accord  for  the  Protection  of
Species at Risk in Canada. Under this agreement, the Canadian Endangered Species Conservation Council was
created to determine responses to assessments made by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in
Canada (COSEWIC), the independent body of scientists responsible for designating the status of species.

After years of dispute over the conservation and harvest provisions of the Pacific Salmon Treaty, Canada
and the US signed the Pacific Salmon Agreement in 1999. This agreement established abundance-based fishing
regimes for the salmon fisheries under its jurisdiction. Two bilaterally managed regional funds were created to
promote cooperation, improve fisheries management, and assist salmon and habitat enhancement efforts. The
Agreement also included a commitment by the two countries to improve how scientific information is obtained,
shared and applied to salmon management decisions.

The North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC) was established by the Convention for
the  Conservation  of  Anadromous  Stocks  in  the  North  Pacific  Ocean (the  Convention)  which  became
effective in 1993. The NPAFC includes Canada, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Russia, and the U.S., the primary
states of origin for salmon stocks in the North Pacific. The Convention prohibits directed fishing for salmonids
on the high seas of the North Pacific and includes provisions to minimize the number of salmonids taken in

(cid:228)
44 Wild Salmon Policy

other fisheries. The NPAFC promotes the conservation of salmonids in the North Pacific and its adjacent seas
and serves as a venue for cooperation in and coordination of enforcement activities and scientific research.

On May 29, 1993, Yukon First Nations, Canada and Yukon signed the “Umbrella Final Agreement”
under which treaties with individual Yukon First Nations would be negotiated. Since then, a number of such
treaties (the “Yukon Final Agreements”) have been entered into between individual Yukon First Nations, Canada
and Yukon. Some of the provisions of those treaties apply to the management of wild Pacific salmon.

The Nisga’a Final Agreement, the first “modern” treaty in British Columbia, took effect on May 11, 2000
after ratification of the Final Agreement by the Nisga’a Nation and the enactment of federal and Provincial
settlement legislation. The Nisga’a Final Agreement applies to the management of salmon originating in the Nass
Area, as defined in the Final Agreement. Other “modern” treaties are being negotiated between First Nations,
Canada and British Columbia in the British Columbia Treaty Commission process.

Policies and Programs

In  1986,  DFO  introduced  the  Policy  for  the  Management  of  Fish  Habitat 29 to  provide  guidance  to
Departmental staff, developers and the public on habitat conservation, restoration and development. The policy’s
overall objective is a net gain in the productive capacity of fish habitat, using the guiding principle of “no net
loss” to ensure that habitat is conserved.

The Aboriginal Fisheries Strategy (AFS) was launched in 1992 in response to the Supreme Court of
Canada’s Sparrow decision on the Aboriginal food fishery.30 The AFS program is applicable where DFO manages
the fishery and where land claims settlements have not already put a fisheries management regime in place. It seeks
to provide for the effective management and regulation of fishing by Aboriginal communities through negotiation
of mutually acceptable and time-limited agreements between the Department and Aboriginal groups.

In  1998,  A  New  Direction  for  Canada’s  Pacific  Salmon  Fisheries 31 established  conservation  as  the
primary objective for managing the wild salmon resource. The new policy set out 12 broad principles in the areas
of  conservation,  sustainable  use  and  improved  decision-making.  It  stated  that  conservation  should  take
precedence over other uses and that a precautionary approach to fisheries management should be adopted.

New Directions called for more detailed policies to put its principles into operation. An Allocation Policy
for Pacific Salmon 32 confirmed the precedence of conservation and described a balanced allocation among the
commercial, recreational and aboriginal fisheries once conservation requirements have been met. A Policy for
Selective Fishing in Canada’s Pacific Fisheries 33 outlined principles and an implementation framework for
selective  harvest  practices,  as  part  of  a  long-term  conservation  and  sustainable  use  strategy.  For  improved
decision-making, there is work underway to create stakeholder committees that will help develop salmon harvest
plans, as well as a formal public policy advisory process.

The  Aboriginal  Aquatic  Resource  and  Oceans  Management  Program (AAROM)  announced  in
October 2003 will help Aboriginal groups acquire expertise to participate more effectively in processes for aquatic
resources and oceans management.34 A major objective of AAROM is to provide these groups with the capacity
to contribute to technical and advisory committees in areas of DFO responsibility, including fisheries and habitat
management and oceans planning and management.

Developing  integrated  strategic  plans  for  individual  CUs  and  groups  of  CUs  will  need  extensive  detailed
information on the status of wild salmon, their habitat and ecosystem to be brought together and collated with
information  on  fisheries  and  watershed  activities.  In  addition,  broad  based  input  on  possible  management
actions and their potential impacts will need to be received, considered and discussed in an organised way to
arrive at reasoned and informed management decisions.  The range of information that will need to be processed
and the complex and sometimes controversial nature of the issues involved calls for a formal, structured and open
procedure to be used in developing strategic plans.

The five-step planning procedure outlined below is proposed in this policy to assist in strategic planning.
This  procedure  breaks  down  decision-making  into  a  logical  and  manageable  sequence  that  reflects  standard
decision-making  practices  in  many  private  and  public  agencies.35 In  addition,  it  is  designed  to  enhance
integration  and  open  up  current  salmon  planning  processes  to  greater  public  involvement.  It  provides  for
improved dialogue among the affected parties and enables them to participate throughout the development of
plans  from  the  establishment  of  planning  priorities  to  the  identification  of  management  alternatives,  their
evaluation and the selection of a preferred management alternative.

In the longer term, the application of the planning procedure and the development of integrated salmon
plans will be the primary responsibility of appropriate representative planning bodies within a new integrated
planning  structure  (Action  Step  4.2).  In  the  interim,  the  Department  will  bring  together  First  Nations  and
various  interests  from  existing  planning  processes,  as  needed,  to  provide  focused  recommendations  for
conservation and re-building conservation units that are in low abundance (Action Step 4.1).

Step 1
Identify planning priorities

As a starting point for planning, DFO staff will provide an overview report that identifies the CUs exploited by
fisheries within each planning unit and gives summary information on their biological status (Red, Amber or
Green). Key habitat and ecosystem constraints or threats to individual CUs will also be summarised by watershed.
For CUs in the Red zone more detailed reports will also be provided as they become available. These detailed
reports will consider and incorporate ATK, where available, and be subject to peer review through PSARC.

Based on this information and their knowledge of local circumstances, First Nations and other participants
in the planning process will be asked to develop key priorities for the each planning unit. These priorities will be
established consistent with the WSP objectives and principles, and will include the re-building of CUs where
these  fall  below  their  established  lower  benchmarks.  However,  priorities  may  also  include  rebuilding  or
enhancing returns of wild salmon where these are below their sustainable production potential, or maintaining
harvest levels in First Nations or other fisheries.

For every planning unit, Step 1 will provide a list of specific key priorities that are to be addressed in the

development of integrated salmon management plans.

Step 2
Identify resource management options and alternative management strategies

At Step 2, several alternative management strategies will be developed in consultation with First Nations and
other  participants  in  the  planning  process.  Specific  management  options  proposed  may  include  fisheries
management measures such as fishing time and area restrictions or habitat restoration activities or watershed

development constraints or enhancement initiatives. At this stage in the planning process it will be important
that no realistic management option is eliminated from consideration. The specific options identified through
these consultations will be used either singly or in combination to develop two or more alternative strategies for
addressing the management priorities for the planning unit.

For every planning unit, Step 2 will provide a number of alternative strategies that reflect a realistic range

of different approaches to addressing the management priorities for each planning unit.

Step 3
Establish biological, social, and economic performance indicators

At Step 3, input from First Nations and other participants in the planning process will be used to develop an
evaluation framework for comparing the management alternatives developed in Step 2. This will require First
Nations and others to identify explicit, measurable performance indicators applicable to the planning unit, its
component CUs and their underlying local populations. These indicators should be suitable both to rate and
rank the likely performance of each management alternative before making decisions, and to assess performance
over time following decision-making and implementation. The indicators should directly relate to the biological
objectives  (safeguard  the  genetic  diversity  of  wild  salmon  and  maintain  the  integrity  of  their  habitat  and
ecosystem) and the social and economic objectives (manage fisheries for sustainable benefits) of the WSP. To be
useful, the indicators collectively will need to fully reflect the concerns and interests of First Nations and other
participants in the planning process.

For  each  planning  unit,  Step  3  will  provide  a  credible,  broadly  accepted  management  assessment

framework that captures and reflects all significant biological, social, and economic considerations.

Step 4
Assess the likely impacts of management alternatives

At Step 4, the alternative management strategies identified in Step 2 will be evaluated using the performance
indicators developed in Step 3. The evaluation process will be forward-looking and focused on estimating the
“future” impacts (both positive and negative) of each strategy on each of the indicators for the planning unit.
These predictions will need to reflect the uncertainties and risks associated with each management alternative.
Under the Wild Salmon Policy, DFO will play a lead role in providing or obtaining these predictions from
appropriate technical experts. For some planning units, computer simulation models may be available to assist,
but in other cases it will be necessary to rely on expert opinion. To facilitate comparison between management
alternatives the likely "net effect" of each management alternative relative to a common base case (e.g. status quo
management) on all of the selected indicators for the planning unit will be projected for appropriate time periods.

Step 4 will provide a set of predicted outcomes for each alternative management strategy.

Step 5
Select the preferred management alternative

The predicted outcomes from Step 4 will help in selecting a preferred management strategy. In many cases,
tradeoffs  will  be  apparent  among  different  biological,  social,  and  economic  indicators.  It  is  anticipated  that
differences of opinion will occur between individuals and interest groups about the “best” alternative because of
their different priorities and tolerances to risks.

The goal will be to use constructive dialogue among First Nations and others involved in the planning
process  to  resolve  these  differences,  find  compromise  solutions  and  to  develop  consensus  recommendations
wherever  possible  for  each  planning  unit.  In  the  absence  of  consensus,  differences  of  view  will  be  fully

documented to inform final decision-making. The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans will consider the input
received and will make the final decisions. Records of all decisions will be made available to the public.

The  decisions  made  for  each  planning  unit  will  collectively  form  the  regional  strategic  plan  for  the
management  of  fisheries  and  watersheds.  The  plan  will  include  activities  and  management  actions  to  be
undertaken over a medium- to long-term timeframe. It will also stipulate explicit biological targets to be achieved
for  individual  Conservation  Units  and  groups  of  CUs  and,  where  appropriate,  anticipated  timeframes  for
rebuilding. All of this information will be documented in an Integrated Management Plan for Pacific salmon.
One of the challenges in successfully managing wild salmon is to achieve consensus on how to address
conservation concerns while accounting for the social and economic impacts of alternative management actions.
In  the  planning  process  described  here,  the  interested  parties  will  be  directly  engaged  throughout  the
development of management plans from the establishment of planning priorities through to the evaluation and
selection  of  the  preferred  management  alternative.  The  deliberations  will  be  guided  by  the  principles  and
objectives expressed the WSP, and the acceptability of the recommended management actions will be determined
by the degree to which they advance the overall policy goal of restoring and maintaining healthy and diverse
salmon populations for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity.
