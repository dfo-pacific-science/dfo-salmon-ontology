ABSTRACT

The  goal  of  Canada's  Wild  Salmon  Policy  (WSP)  is  to  restore  and  maintain  healthy  and
diverse salmon populations and their habitats for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of
Canada  in  perpetuity.  To  achieve  that  goal,  the  WSP  requires  that  biological  status  be
assessed  for  all  geographically,  ecologically,  and  genetically  distinct  populations,  or
Conservation  Units  (CUs).  One  component  of  that  assessment  is  identifying  quantifiable
metrics of biological status and benchmarks along those metrics. Here, we provide a toolkit
of  metrics  and  benchmarks  of  status,  which  will  set  the  stage  for  future  CU  assessments.
Specifically, we propose a multi-criteria approach for assessing status that uses information
on current abundances, trends in abundance over time, distribution of spawners, and fishing
mortality relative to stock productivity. That approach captures the multiple dimensions of
population status that will be important to achieve WSP goals better than assessments based
on abundances alone. Furthermore, any redundancy in information content among criteria
may allow for increased flexibility when assessing stocks that differ widely in data quantity
and quality. Here, we identify quantifiable metrics and candidate benchmarks drawn from
the scientific literature and previous management experience. Using a simulation model, we
further evaluate a subset of those benchmarks on two performance metrics: the probability
of  extirpation  over  the  long  term  and  the  probability  of  recovery  to  a  target.  Finally,  we
apply  those  metrics  and  candidate  benchmarks  to  two  example  CUs,  Takla/Trembleur
sockeye  salmon  (Early  Stuart  run-timing  group  of  the  Fraser  River)  and  Hecate  Strait
Lowlands pink salmon (odd year).

RÉSUMÉ

Le but de la Politique concernant le saumon sauvage (PSS) du Canada vise à rétablir et de
maintenir  la  santé  et  la  diversité  des  populations  de  saumon  et  de  leurs  habitats,  pour  le
bénéfice et le plaisir durables des Canadiens et Canadiennes. Pour réaliser l’objectif de la
PSS,  on  doit  évaluer  la  situation  biologique  de  toutes  les  populations,  ou  des  unités  de
conservation  (UC),  distinctes  du  point  de  vue  géographique,  écologique  et  génétique.  Un
des volets de cette évaluation consiste à préciser des mesures quantifiables de la situation
biologique et des repères correspondants. Nous offrons ici une boîte à outils de mesures et
de  repères  de  la  situation  qui  définissent  les  balises  des  futures  évaluations  des  UC.  De
façon plus précise, nous proposons une approche à plusieurs variables pour l’évaluation de
la  situation  qui  fait  appel  aux  renseignements  sur  l’abondance  actuelle,  aux  tendances  de
l’abondance au fil du temps, à la répartition des géniteurs et à la mortalité par pêche en lien
avec la productivité des stocks. Cette approche tient compte des multiples dimensions de la
situation de la population, importantes pour l’atteinte des buts de la PSS, mieux que ne le
feraient  des  évaluations  fondées  seulement  sur  l’abondance.  En  outre,  toute  redondance
dans  le  contenu  de  l’information  des  critères  permettrait  une  plus  grande  souplesse  dans
l’évaluation des stocks pour lesquels les données diffèrent considérablement sur le plan de
la  quantité  et  de  la  qualité.  Nous  précisons  ici  des  mesures  quantifiables  et  des  repères
candidats fondés sur la documentation scientifique et les expériences de gestion antérieures.
À  l’aide  d’un  modèle  de  simulation,  nous  évaluons  plus  à  fond  un  sous-ensemble  de  ces
repères en fonction de deux mesures de rendement : la probabilité de disparition de l’espèce
d’un endroit donné à long terme et la probabilité de rétablissement par rapport à un objectif.
Enfin, nous appliquons ces mesures et ces repères candidats à deux UC témoins, le saumon
rouge  des  lacs  Takla  et  Trembleur  (groupe  de  remontes  précoces  de  la  Stuart  du  fleuve
Fraser) et le saumon rose des basses terres du détroit d’Hécate (année impaire).

1.  GLOSSARY

Benchmark: synonymous with biological reference point.
Biological Reference Point (BRP): a biological benchmark against which the attributes of
a stock (e.g., abundance or fishing mortality rate) can be measured in order to determine its
status.
Conservation  Unit  (CU):  a  group  of  wild  salmon  sufficiently  isolated  from  other  groups
that, if lost, is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable time frame (e.g., a
human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations).
COSEWIC: Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada.
Depensatory  mortality:  mortality  rate  that  increases  as  the  size  of  the  population
decreases.
Diversity (of salmon): the genetic variation and adaptations to different environments that
have accumulated between populations of salmon (defined by the Wild Salmon Policy).
Inbreeding  depression:  Mating  or  crossing  of  individuals  more  closely  related  than
average pairs in a population resulting in reduced fitness of progeny.
Lower benchmark: a reference point in biological status associated with significant losses
in production between the Amber and Red zones, and which allows for a substantial buffer
between it and any level of abundance that could lead to a CU being considered at risk of
extinction by COSEWIC.
Metric: a quantifiable measure.
Production  model:  a  quantitative  representation  of  the  production  of  recruits  in  one
generation from spawners in the previous generation.
Productivity: number of recruits produced per spawner.
Risk: magnitude of a negative outcome weighted by its probability of occurrence.
Risk  tolerance:  attitude  toward  uncertainties  in  the  occurrence  and/or  magnitude  of  a
negative outcome.
Spatial structure: geographic relationship among spawning groups.
Spawning group: a sub-population within a CU, analogous to a counting location.
Upper benchmark: (or higher benchmark) a reference point in biological status associated
with  harvests  at  the  level  expected  to  provide,  on  an  average  annual  basis,  the  maximum
catch for a CU, given existing environmental conditions.
Wild salmon: salmon that have spent their entire life cycle in the wild and originate from
parents that were also produced by natural spawning and continuously lived in the wild.

INTRODUCTION

“The  goal  of  the  Wild  Salmon  Policy  is  to restore and maintain healthy and diverse
salmon populations and their habitats for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada
in perpetuity.”

~Wild Salmon Policy 2005

To  achieve  its  goal,  the  Wild  Salmon  Policy  (WSP)  describes  several  strategies  that
will be adopted, the first of which is standardized monitoring of salmon status (Fisheries and
Oceans  Canada,  2005)(p.16-19).  There  are  three  action  items  under  that  strategy.  The  first
item, the identification of Conservation Units (CU), has been completed (Holtby and Ciruna,
2007).  The  second  action  step  requires  the  development  of  criteria  to  assess  CUs  and  the
identification of benchmarks to represent their biological status. The third action item is the
actual determination of biological status for each CU. This document addresses the first part
of the second item, namely, an examination of the criteria that are available for determining
the  status  of  a  CU.  Our  overall  goal  is  to  provide  a  toolkit  of  metrics  and  benchmarks  of
biological status, which will set the stage for future assessments of CUs.

In  the  Introduction,  we  begin  by  attempting  to  clarify  the  bewildering  terminology
involved  in  any  discussion  of  status.  In  Section  3,  we  outline  quantifiable  metrics  for  each
class  of  indicators,  candidate  benchmarks  drawn  from  the  scientific  literature  and  previous
management  experience,  and  a  simulation  model  that  evaluates  performance  of  lower
benchmarks on two criteria, probability of extirpation over the long term and probability of
recovery to a target (see the Technical Documentation on the Evaluation of Benchmarks for
Conservation  Units  in  Canada's  Wild  Salmon  Policy  (Holt,  2009)).  Using  the  simulation
model  we  also  compare  the  performance  of  lower  benchmarks  under  various  changes  in
productivity (to evaluate, for example, how precautionary benchmarks are given uncertainty
in future trends in productivity, as well as uncertainties in other components of the fisheries
system). In Section 4, the metrics and candidate benchmarks are applied to two example CUs,
Takla/Trembleur  sockeye  salmon  (Early  Stuart  run-timing  group  of  the  Fraser  River)  and
Hecate  Strait  Lowlands  pink  salmon  (odd  year).  Those  two  examples  were  chosen  to
demonstrate  CUs  with  high  quality  (Takla/Trembleur)  and  poor  quality  (Hecate  Strait
Lowlands) data. Furthermore, Takla/Trembleur is of immediate management concern because
of recent poor recruitments.  Our intentions are to demonstrate the methodology developed in
the pervious sections, and not provide formal advice  for  those  two  CUs.  We  conclude  with
further steps required to assess status of CUs. As described in the WSP, benchmarks will "be
determined  on  a  case  by  case  basis,  depending  on  the  species  and  types  of  information
available"  (p.18).  Further  work  will  be  required  to  adapt  these  metrics  and  benchmarks  to
other CUs.

2.1  A conceptual assessment framework

We  often  confuse  state  and  status  because  a  reference  frame  is  usually  implicitly
understood.  If  we  were  to  declare  that  the  temperature  in  a  room  was  +10°X  then  nobody
could  determine  the  status  of  that  room  in  the  reference  frame  of  human  temperature
preferences. If we were to then reveal that °X is a scale using Centigrade degrees relative to a

  1

nominal value of 22°C, we would know immediately that the status of the room temperature
was hot but not intolerably so1. Revealing that the ambient noise level in the room was -45
dB(A) would indicate a quiet room but would not tell you whether there was enough light to
read a book. In other words, to determine status one needs to specify a reference frame and a
state variable and one or more benchmarks that are meaningful within the reference frame.

2.2  Benchmarks and Biological Reference Points

A biological reference point (BRP) is a benchmark against which an attribute of the
stock (e.g., abundance) can be measured in order to determine its status (Caddy and Mahon,
1995).  The  two  terms  are  used  interchangeably  in  the  fisheries  literature,  but,  with  the
exception of this section, we use the term benchmark to be consistent with the Wild Salmon
Policy.  We  use  BRP  only  when  referring  to  previous  studies  that  used  that  term.  Although
reference points are often used to describe harvest rules (e.g., thresholds in abundances which
trigger  management  actions),  our  description  of  benchmarks  is  intended  describe  zones  of
biological  status  only.  Identifying  harvest  rules  requires  information  on  other  habitat,
ecological,  and  socio-economic  factors  not  considered  here  (but  included  in  Strategies  2,  3,
and 4 of the Wild Salmon Policy, respectively).

Caddy  and  Mahon  (1995)  observed  that  BRPs  are  of  two  types.  One  type,
which  they  termed  a  Target  Reference  Point  or  TRP,  indicates  “a  state  of  a  fishery  and/or
resource that is considered to be desirable and at which management action, whether during
development  or  stock  rebuilding  should  aim”  (ibid.  p.  8).  The  other  type  was  termed  a
Threshold  or  Limit  Reference  Point  (LRP),  and  “indicates  a  state  of  a  fishery  and/or  a
resource which is considered to be undesirable and which management action should avoid”
(ibid.  p.  8).  These  definitions  are  of  conceptual  conditions  or  states  of  a  resource  or  of  a
fishery, and must subsequently be quantified to provide measurable targets or thresholds. In
addition to the LRP and TRP, a Precautionary Reference Point (PRP) has also been defined
(ICES,  1996).  The  PRP  recognizes  that  the  LRP  defines  a  state  that  should  be  avoided  and
that it would be precautionary to instigate fisheries management responses before that state is
reached so as to avoid it.

The  LRP  can  be  regarded  as  a  benchmark  giving  information  about  a  state  of  the
resource that should be avoided to ensure that stocks and their exploitation remain within safe
biological  limits.  Defined  in  this  way  the  LRP  is  not  prescriptive  in  any  way.  However,
FAO’s Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (FAO, 1995) does link reference points to
fisheries management actions as part of the Fisheries Precautionary Approach (ibid. p. 12-13).
As the WSP makes abundantly clear, (e.g., p. 17) all sorts of considerations, of which stock
state is just one, are made in managing fisheries. Consequently, the WSP benchmarks cannot
be linked to any particular management action other than the very general ones of reducing or
redirecting fisheries (ibid. p. 24) when it has been decided to reverse or stabilize a downward
CU trajectory.

1 Assuming that the person assessing status is familiar with °C, not old, in good health, and appropriately
dressed.

2.3  Benchmarks and the role of Science

The  proper  role  of  Science  is  to  determine  the  safe  biological  limit  of  the  resource.
That limit can be defined in a multitude of ways but, generally, it will be an abundance below
which long-term average production would be compromised (a lower abundance on spawner
abundances,  or  Slower  benchmark).  Such  a  threshold  will  be  determined  within  a  specified
production model for the resource, will be made with a set of assumptions, and should, as far
as is possible, be free of any implicit assumptions of acceptable or unacceptable risk. This last
attribute requires some explanation. In applying the model, there are many uncertainties. For
example, because all models approximate nature, we are often not certain which production
model is most appropriate. The parameter values of our particular model and the data used to
estimate  them  are  often  highly  uncertain.  Describing  and  quantifying  uncertainties  has
become very important in the provision of advice, but deciding what to do about them is the
role of fisheries management. Why this is so is illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. A hypothetical relationship between a lower benchmark (SLBM) and the probability
of achieving a target within a specified time. The deterministic SLBM is the level of
spawner abundance such that the target would be attained with certainty within the
specified  time  following  the  particular  management  if  there  was  no  uncertainty,

  3

i.e.,  perfect  knowledge.  The  precautionary  SLBM  accounts  for  uncertainty  in
achieving the target.

With a specified target, management action(s), and time allowed to achieve the target,
and perfect knowledge of the fisheries system, it is possible to calculate the minimum level of
abundance from which the population can successfully recover2 (deterministic Slower  benchmark,
Figure 1). Under the assumption of perfect knowledge, it would be known with certainty that
recovery could not be achieved if there were fewer fish. As various types of uncertainty are
incorporated into the model, it is possible to generate a relationship between the value of S
where the specified management action was initiated and the probability that the target would
be achieved within the specified time (precautionary Slower  benchmark, Figure 1). In addition to
the  model,  the  target,  the  allowable  recovery  time  and  all  their  associated  uncertainties,  the
choice of a particular lower benchmark depends on the probability level assumed, i.e., the risk
tolerance. Decisions about risk tolerance are largely political, although science should assist
fisheries  management  in  interpreting  risk  assessments  (Hauge  et  al.,  2007).  The  role  for
Science is to identify candidate benchmarks and, where possible, describe the probabilities of
achieving  the  target  under  a  set  of  assumptions  (e.g.,  MSY  in  a  given  time  frame  in  the
absence of fishing) for each, and not to prescribe specific values. Alternatively, Science can
provide  a  probability  function  that  would  specify  a  value  of  the  lower  benchmark  given  a
level of risk tolerance (i.e., Figure 1 with axes reversed).

2.4  Idealized framework for determining precautionary lower benchmarks

An idealized framework for determining precautionary lower benchmarks is shown in
Table 1 and Figure 2. The framework comprises nine steps which are each the responsibility
of  either  Science  or  Fisheries  Management.  In  this  framework,  fisheries  management  is  a
generic  term  for  those  requesting  advice  from  Science.  In  the  particular  case  of  the  WSP
benchmarks, some of the steps are specified by the WSP itself.

The nine steps have already been mentioned but for clarity are tabulated here for an
example reference frame specified as biological production. The inputs and  outputs of each
step are made specific to the WSP, as detailed in the Section 2.5.

2.5  WSP framework for status determination

In this section we examine the framework for assessing biological status specified by
the WSP (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 2005)(p. 16-18), and begin populating Table 1 of the
conceptual framework outlined in Section 2.4 for identifying benchmarks.

2.5.1  Identifying benchmarks

The  Wild  Salmon  Policy  describes  an  upper  and  a  lower  benchmark  that  delineate
three zones in status: Green, Amber, and Red (Figure 3). Those benchmarks "identify when
the  biological  production  status  of  a  CU  has  changed  significantly"    (Fisheries  and  Oceans
Canada,  2005)(p.18).  In  particular,  the  upper  benchmark  could  be  "the  level  expected  to
provide,  on  an  average  annual  basis,  the  maximum  annual  catch  for  a  CU,  given  existing

  6

environmental  conditions",  and  where  "there  would  not  be  a  high  probability  of  losing  the
CU"  (p.18).  In  contrast,  the  lower  benchmark  will  be  established  "at  a  level  of  abundance
high enough to ensure there is a substantial buffer between it and any level of abundance that
could  lead  to  a  CU  being  considered  at  risk  of  extinction  by  COSEWIC"(Fisheries  and
Oceans  Canada,  2005)(p.18).  To  determine  conservation  status,  COSEWIC  considers  a
defined set of five criteria (Table 2 in (COSEWIC, 2006)). Of these criteria, only criterion D
deals  primarily  with  abundance  (Table  2).  In  assessing  the  extinction  risk  of  marine  and
anadromous  fish  species,  COSEWIC  has  usually  used  criterion  A  (e.g.,  (e.g.  COSEWIC,
2003a;  COSEWIC,  2003b)  since  that  criterion  is  most  applicable  to  any  species  where  the
absolute abundance is either unknown or is too large for the other criteria to apply. Absolute
abundance  will  not  be  known  for  many  CUs  of  Pacific  salmon  since  the  methods  used  to
estimate escapements mostly provide indices of abundance.

Description

A.  Declining
Total
Population

Status is determined by observed, estimated, inferred or
suspected rates of decline in total population size over a defined
period. Thresholds are dependent on whether or not the
reduction or its causes have ceased or are understood or are
reversible. Knowledge of declines can come from direct
observation or may be inferred from such things as abundance
indices, habitat loss, levels of exploitation, or other mortality
factors.

B.  Small

distribution,
and decline
or fluctuation

Status is determined by either the extent of occurrence or the
area of occupancy in conjunction with declines in either of
them or in habitat quality, number of populations or number of
individuals.

C.  Small total
population
size and
decline

Status is determined by both the number of mature individuals
and either a continuing decline in number or a population
structure that has most mature individuals in small and
fragmented populations.

D.  Very small

population or
restricted
distribution
E.  Quantitative
analysis

Status is determined primarily by the number of mature
individuals but can be modified by the area of occupancy or
human threats

Status is determined by an estimated probability of extinction in
the wild

In  addition,  the  WSP  states  that  the  lower  benchmark  will  use  a  "buffer  [that]  will
account for uncertainty in data and control of harvest management" (p.18). By accounting for
those uncertainties, the definition of the lower benchmark is consistent with the precautionary
lower benchmark described in Section 2.4.

2.5.2  Indicators of status, incorporating uncertainties

To  meet  the  requirements  for  benchmarks  described  in  the  WSP,  we  suggest  four
classes of indicators, the first of which, abundances (production), is clearly described in the
WSP  as  one  approach  for  assessing  status  (p.  17).  To  minimize  COSEWIC  listings  (the
second requirement), we suggest two additional classes of indicators: time trends in spawner
abundances and distribution (the later is also suggested in the WSP as an indicator of status).
Although COSEWIC criteria do not explicitly include fishing pressure relative to sustainable
levels (i.e., relative to intrinsic productivity of the stock), we include that as a fourth class of
indicators to assess the likelihood of continued trends in abundances (declines or increases)
given current fishing effort. That fourth class differs from the first three in that it reflects an
external  stressor  instead  of  an  intrinsic  property  of  the  population.  Figure  4  illustrates  the
hierarchical  framework  that  relates  indicators,  quantifiable  metrics  within  classes  of

  8

indicators (examples of which are shown in the right column of Table 3 and are described in
more  detail  in  Section  3),  and  benchmarks  on  each  metric.  The  order  in  which  we  present
classes  of  indicators  is  not  meant  to  represent  a  priority  for  assessment.  Instead  the  chosen
metrics  and  their  relative  weight  in  the  overall  assessment  will  be  CU-specific  and  vary
according to data quality and quantity among other considerations.

Uncertainties  can  be  incorporated  into  status  assessment  (step  8  of  the  idealized
assessment  framework,  Table  1)  qualitatively  by  classifying  the  magnitude  of  uncertainties

  10

into  three  zones  (high,  moderate  and  low),  or  quantitatively  using  a  simulation  model  to
evaluate probabilistic outcomes. For the qualitative method, the magnitude of measurement or
observation errors is classified, in part, based on the method used to collect the data, such as
visual surveys, fence counts, or mark-recapture experiments. Pestal and Cass (2007) provide a
framework for classifying populations of sockeye salmon on the Fraser River according to the
magnitude of uncertainty in the observed spawner data. We have adapted their methodology
and  the  one  from  Crawford  and  Rumsey  (2009)  to  classify  CUs  into  the  Red  zone  (high
uncertainties), Amber zone (moderate uncertainties), and Green zone (low uncertainties), as
described in more detail in Section 3.5.1.

A  more  rigorous  and  quantitative  approach  for  accounting  for  multiples  sources  of
uncertainties using probabilistic performance criteria (e.g. probability of achieving a goal or
endpoint)  is  Monte  Carlo  simulation  modelling.  Moreover,  one  of  the  listing  criteria  for
COSEWIC  (criterion  E)  is  derived  from  assessing  the  probability  of  extinction  (i.e.,  a
probabilistic criterion) using  quantitative  analyses such  as simulation modelling. We used a
simulation model that incorporated uncertainties in biological and management  components
of the fisheries system to evaluate lower benchmarks on  two classes  of  indicators (spawner
abundances  and  fishing  mortality)  with  two  performance  criteria,  the  probability  of
extirpation to long term and probability of recovery to a target over one-three generation(s).
For  details  on  the  structure  of  the  simulation  model  and  results,  see  the  technical
documentation  on  the  Evaluation  of  Benchmarks  for  Conservation  Units  in  Canada's  Wild
Salmon  Policy  (Holt,  2009).  Further  work  will  be  required  to  develop  models  that  relate
performance  metrics  to  benchmarks  on  the  two  remaining  class  of  indicators,  trends  in
spawner abundances and distribution of spawners.

2.5.3  Risk tolerance

"The determination of the lower benchmark, will include consideration of a risk
tolerance" (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 2005) (p.17).  As discussed in Sections 2.3 and 2.4
consideration of risk tolerance is the responsibility of fisheries management and the adoption
of any particular risk tolerance is the responsibility of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
Here we adapt a risk classification scheme for probabilities of population decline developed
in DFO's "Fishery Decision-Making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach"
(2009), in order to categorize probabilities of realizing a specified outcome when evaluating
lower benchmarks (Table 4).

  11

Table 4. Example risk classification scheme adapted from DFO's "Fishery Decision-making
Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach" (2009)for probabilities of realizing an
outcome.

~50%
50%-75%
75%-95%
>95%

Risk category
Very low
Low
Moderately low
Neutral
Moderately low
High
Very high

This classification is similar to one provided by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries
Organization to aid in setting limit reference points (very low probability defined as ≤ 5% and
low probability defined as ≤ 20%) (Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization, 2004).

In the absence of alternative guidelines for categorizing probabilities of realizing

outcomes, we follow the classification scheme in Table 4 when evaluating probabilities of
extirpation over the long term and probabilities of recovery to a target for CUs. This scheme
represents only one possible example; alternative guidelines on risk classification that are
directly linked to stakeholder risk tolerances should be considered by fisheries management.
To emphasize, Science is limited to providing a function that relates any plausible value of
the benchmark to the probability of meeting a criterion (e.g., recovery to a target or
extirpation). Fisheries management is responsible for identifying risk tolerance.

In Canada, Pestal and Cass (2007) provide an assessment framework for Fraser Rivers
sockeye  salmon  based  on  three  considerations:  status,  vulnerability,  and  direct  human
impacts,  in  order  to  "establish  a  consistent,  transparent  framework  that  translates  general
policies  and  objectives  into  practical  guidelines  for  prioritizing  assessment  projects"  (p.6).
Although  their  goal  is  broad-reaching,  one  of  the  policies  they  consider  is  Canada's  Wild
Salmon  Policy.  Their  indicators  of  status,  vulnerability,  and  direct  human  impacts  overlap
with  the  indicators  identified  here.    In  particular,  their  measure  of  status  includes  current
abundances,  changes  in  abundance  over  time,  and  distribution  over  space;  vulnerability
includes productivity and diversity; and direct human impacts include fishing mortality.

2.6  Comparison to other assessment frameworks

The assessment framework identified here is consistent with previous frameworks for
assessing  viability  of  Pacific  salmon  stocks.  For  example,  in  the  United  States,  technical
recovery  teams  (TRTs)  have  been  tasked  with  identifying  performance  conditions  (viability
criteria) that when met, indicate that a population is not likely to go extinct (McElhany et al.,
2000).  Although  the  goals  of  the  TRTs  differ  somewhat  from  those  of  the  Wild  Salmon
Policy, both include consideration of probabilities of extirpation. In one study by the TRTs,
McElhany et al. (2006) identified what they considered to be the most important dimensions
for population viability: abundance and productivity, spatial structure (including habitat use),
and diversity. The last dimension, diversity, considers the minimum abundances required to

  12

maintain  genetic  diversity  for  long-term  population  persistence.  Although  diversity  is  not
explicitly included in our list of indicators, COSEWIC criteria D (very small population size,
of <1000 fish for a "threatened" listing) allows for sufficient genetic diversity for long-term
population persistence if populations are above that level (Bradford and Wood, 2004) (though
Reed  et  al.  (2003)  suggest  that  7000  is  a  more  realistic  minimum  population  size  for  long-
term persistence).

2.7  Assessment of biological production status and enhancement

The roles of salmonid enhancement in conservation and production in Pacific Canada
are  discussed  in  the  WSP  and  assurance  is  given  that  possible  interactions  of  wild  and
enhanced fish will be managed through integrated planning (Strategy 4, p. 24-31) and through
appropriate  technical  practices  at  enhancement  facilities.  While  these  generalities  and
assurances are quite appropriate for a policy document, the more mundane question of how to
deal with enhanced fish in a status assessment are left open.

This general question is important to a status determination because the enhancement
methods  used  in  Pacific  Canada  and  the  locations  of  enhancement  activity  more  often  than
not  result  in  mixtures  of  wild  and  enhanced  fish  spawning  naturally.  However,  the  WSP  is
quite specific in restricting the policy, and hence the determination of status, to fish that are
wild  by  definition.  That  definition  (see  glossary)  has  two  important  implications.  First,  the
definition  cannot  be  easily  operationalized  because  the  offspring  of  enhanced  fish  that
spawned  in  the  wild  cannot  be  distinguished  from  wild  fish.    Second,  given  the  levels  and
duration  of  enhancement  in  some  areas,  it  is  unlikely  that  there  are  any  wild  salmon
remaining.  For  example,  levels  of  enhancement  in  most  chinook  CUs  around  the  Strait  of
Georgia have been intensive for decades and it is likely that few of the natural spawners in
rivers like the Cowichan and Nanaimo Rivers are wild.

Populations  that  are  dominated  by  hatcheries  (i.e.,  with  little  or  no  contribution  of
wild  fish)  are  not  considered  within  CUs  (e.g.,  hatchery  production  on  Robertson  Creek
chinook salmon on the west coast of Vancouver Island are not included in neighbouring CUs)
(Holtby and Ciruna, 2007), and are therefore omitted from WSP assessments. For populations
that  include  both  wild  and  hatchery-origin  fish,  we  are  unable  to  find  any  completely
satisfactory manner to assess status. We could exclude those CUs where levels and duration
of  historical  hatchery  production  are  likely  to  have  resulted  in  the  extirpation  or  near-
extirpation of wild fish. We doubt that this would seem reasonable to most Canadians since it
would remove perhaps a third of chinook CUs and a fifth of coho CUs from consideration.
An alternative is to remove first generation hatchery-origin fish from recruitment time series,
but that option does not adhere to the strict definition of wild salmon given in the WSP since
those  hatchery-origin  fish  would  continue  to  be  tallied  in  spawner  time  series  in  the
subsequent  generation  (and  the  resulting  recruitment).  This  approach  would  consider  the
productivity of fish spawning in the wild instead of wild fish (as defined by the Wild Salmon
Policy), which we consider a reasonable compromise.

The  WSP  excludes  fish  produced  from  managed spawning  channels. That definition
cannot be operationalized because the produced fish are almost never marked (i.e., not even

  13

the  first-generation  fish  can  be  recognized)  and  because  the  spawning  channels  are  usually
small parts of larger systems and so the fish that use them are a mix of  enhanced and wild
fish.  We  propose  to  include  these  fish  in  both  recruitment  and  spawner  time  series  if  the
channel  management  did  not  exclude  natural  mate  selection  and  imposed  the  same  sorts  of
control that fisheries can produce3.

Although there are a growing number of demonstrations that enhanced salmon are less
fit than their wild counterparts (e.g. Araki et al., 2007; Goodman, 2005; Heath et al., 2003;
Hindar et al., 2006; Jonsson and Jonsson, 2006; Utter, 2004), hatchery practices in B.C. might
avoid some of the effects (Heggenes et al., 2006). DFO biologists generally assert that there
are no definitive studies in BC and Pacific salmon where hatchery practices are substantially
different  from  those  in  the  US  and  Europe  (C.  Cross,  pers.  comm.,  Habitat  Enhancement
Branch,  Fisheries  and  Oceans  Canada,  Vancouver).  Only  Goodman  (2005)  provides  some
guidance  on  the  possible  safe  limits  to  enhancement  for  avoiding  catastrophic  losses  to
fitness.

Another way in which enhanced production may affect wild fish is through increased
competition for limited resources in the marine habitat, potentially resulting in reduced body
size and/or survival overall, or worse, a greater reduction in the survival of wild fish because
of the competitive superiority of hatchery fish. This effect was proposed as the reason for the
increasing proportion of hatchery coho in the Strait of Georgia during the 1980’s and 1990’s
(e.g. Sweeting et al., 2003). However, more recent trends from the same authors suggests that
variation in the relative abundance of hatchery and wild coho is due to interactions of release
timing and oceanographic variability rather than density dependence (Beamish et al., 2008).

Although  evidence  suggests  that  enhancement  may  have  deleterious  effects  on  the
fitness and production of wild fish, there is insufficient information to proceed further at this
time  in  incorporating  levels  of  enhancement  into  assessments  of  status,  aside  from  the
exclusion of first-generation hatchery fish from the spawner and recruitment time series.

3.  Specific metrics to assess status

3.1  Spawner abundances

For Pacific salmon, understanding the relationship between spawner abundances and
recruitment  is  essential  for  identifying  the  level  of  spawners  (or  benchmark)  below  which
yield  is  reduced.  Despite  well-known  pitfalls  of  stock-recruitment  models  (e.g.,  biased
parameter estimates resulting from short or uninformative data), they have long been used as
a basis for management decisions (Walters and Korman, 2001). Approaches to address some
of  those  problems  have  been  developed,  such  as  Bayesian  analyses  that  incorporate  prior
information  on  carrying  capacity  (Walters  and  Korman,  2001)  and  state-space  models  that
incorporate uncertainties in spawner data (Walters and Korman, 2001).  We suggest deriving
upper  and  lower  benchmarks  on  spawner  abundances  from  stock-recruit  relationships  using

3 Namely, control of spawner numbers and timing, both of which are actively controlled by fisheries.

  14

prior  information  on  carrying  capacity  (where  available)  in  a  Bayesian  approach.  However,
for some CUs, recruitment does not show a compensatory response with spawner abundances
(i.e., a spawner-recruitment relationship does not exist) and/or the assumption of log-normal
variability in recruitment does not hold (S. Cox-Rogers, pers. comm.). In those cases, status
may be assessed using other metrics of status, such as those related to trends in abundance or
distribution  over  time,  current  productivity,  or  spawner  abundances  relative  to  estimates  of
capacity, as appropriate.

Spawner abundance at maximum sustainable yield, SMSY, has been embraced by many
as  a  "target  reference  point"  for  management  (e.g.,  Irvine  et  al.  (2001),  Tompkins  et  al.
(2005)),  and  is  recommended  by  the  UN  as  a  rebuilding  target  for  overfished  stocks  (UN
Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, Annex II). Although
the  Wild    Salmon  Policy  provides  SMSY  as  an  example  upper  benchmark  delineating  Green
and  Amber  zones,  DFO's  Fishery  Decision-Making  Framework  Incorporating
the
Precautionary Approach (2009) (or simply DFO's Decision-Making Framework) recommends
an  provisional  upper  reference  point  for  management  to  delineate  "healthy"  and  "cautious
zones"  of  80%  of  SMSY.  To  be  consistent  with  DFO's  Decision-Making  Framework,  we
recommend  an  upper  benchmark  to  be  equal  to  (or  greater  than)  80%  of  SMSY.  Below  that
spawner abundance, populations are not considered healthy by the Framework and should not
be included in the Green zone of the WSP.

While  agreement  on  upper  benchmarks  is  relatively  close,  consensus  on  lower
benchmarks  delineating  Amber  and  Red  zones  has  not  been  reached.  One  possibility  is
spawner abundances at a specified fraction of MSY recruitment (e.g., 0.5, Figure 5, Table 5
for populations that exhibit a Ricker stock-recruitment relationship). DFO's Decision-Making
Framework suggests a provisional lower reference point (delineating "critical" and "cautious"
zones) of 40% of biomass (or spawner abundances) at MSY (Figure 5, Table 5). Alternatively,
Myers et al. (1994) propose spawner abundances at 50% of maximum recruitment as a lower
benchmark  below  which  "recruitment  to  a  fish  stock  is  seriously  reduced"  (Table  5),  and
Johnston et al. (2002) propose a limit reference point at a level of spawners that would result
in  recovery  to  SMSY  within  one  generation  in  the  absence  of  fishing,  under  equilibrium
conditions  (Figure  5,  Table  5).  Although  the  minimum  spawner  abundance  from  which  the
population has recovered has also been suggested as a lower benchmark (Irvine et al., 2001),
there is no evidence that such a benchmark would leave a "substantial buffer" between it and
spawner  abundances  associated  with  a  high  probability  of  extirpation,  or  that  abundances
would rebuild in the future as they did historically.

To  incorporate  uncertainty  from  inaccurate  estimates  of  SMSY  (due  to,  for  example,
short time series of spawner and recruitment data) into the derivation of benchmarks, instead
of the most-likely point estimate of SMSY, the posterior probability distribution can be used.
That distribution can be derived from Bayesian analyses that incorporate prior information on

  17

spawner abundances at RMAX (Appendix A, Fig. A 1, Fig. A 2, Fig. A 3, Fig. A 4, and Fig. A
5)  or  the  productivity  parameter.  This  approach  is  similar  to  one  used  by  the  Alaska
Department of Fish and Game to account for uncertainty in management targets(Nelson et al.,
2005)  and  by  Bodkter  et  al.  (2007)  to  evaluate  escapement  goals  on  Fraser  River  sockeye
salmon. Careful consideration of the sensitivity of benchmark values to assumptions about the
prior distribution will be required.

For  some  species  and  populations,  the  Ricker  function  may  not  be  an  appropriate
representation  of  the  spawner-recruit  relationship  because  recruitment  does  not  decline  at
high spawner abundances (i.e., overcompensation, a characteristic of the Ricker relationship,
does not occur) or cycle-lines interact to create cyclic patterns in recruitment. In the first case,
a  Beverton-Holt  recruitment  function  may  better  reflect  asymptotic  recruitment  at  high
spawner  abundances.  Although  some  management  parameters  (e.g.,  SMSY)  and  the  related
lower and upper benchmarks (e.g., 40% and 80% of SMSY) can be calculated for the Beverton-
Holt  function  (as  described  in  Table  5  for  the  Ricker  function),  others  cannot  (e.g.,  S  at
RMAX)(Hilborn  and  Walters,  1992)  (p.272).  For  the  second  case,  strong  cyclic  patterns  in
sockeye salmon recruitment in the Fraser River have prompted scientists to consider a Larkin
model (Walters and Staley, 1987) when setting escapement goals for those stocks (Cass and
Grout, 2006; Martell et al., 2008).  That model includes the effects of biological interactions
among cycle lines due to, for example, competition for food or common predators. Closed-
form values of management parameters such as SMSY that vary by cycle line are not available
for  the  Larkin  model.  Numerical  estimates  for  Fraser  River  stocks  are  currently  being
developed  as  part  of  DFO's  Fraser  River  Sockeye  Spawning  Initiative  to  derive  harvest
control rules (A. Huang, Annacis Island, Fisheries and Oceans Canada), and are not estimated
here.  For  demonstration  purposes,  we  use  the  Ricker  relationship  as  an  example  stock-
recruitment model. However, that assumption was relaxed in simulation model that evaluated
lower benchmarks.

When estimates of SMSY are not available because recruitment and/or productivity data
are  missing,  benchmarks  can  instead  be  derived  from  carrying  capacity  (the  maximum
recruitment  that  the  freshwater  habitat  will  support  in  the  absence  of  fishing  mortality)
approximated  from  freshwater  studies  (e.g.,  Shortreed  et  al.(2001)).  One  possible  lower
benchmark is a percentage of carrying capacity, e.g., in the range of 10-20% as suggested by
Johnston et al. (2002) as a "lower reference point" for B.C. steelhead, or 15% as applied to
Skeena River sockeye salmon (Wood,  2004). In a similar way, an upper benchmark can be
derived  from  a  percentage  of  carrying  capacity  instead  of  SMSY.  For  example,  when  the
productivity  parameter  is  1.0  (~2.7  recruits/spawner  at  low  spawner  abundances),  an  upper
benchmark  of  SMSY  is  approximately  equivalent  to  40%  of  carrying  capacity  based  on  the
relationship  between  SMSY  (derived  in  Table  5)  and  spawner  abundances  at  maximum
recruitment
replacement  and
loge(recruits/spawners) at low spawners (Ricker, 1975)).

For  some  CUs  where  data  on  spawner  abundances  are  not  available  or  are  of  poor
quality, fry or smolt abundances or body sizes may provide a rough indication of spawning
status.  For  example,  Bradford  et  al.  (2000)  used  smolt  and  spawner  density  information  to
identify the carrying capacity of Black Creek coho salmon in units of smolts/km. In addition,

  18

body  sizes  may  correlate  with  spawner  abundances  insofar  as  density-dependent  growth
during freshwater stages results in small (large) juveniles when spawners are abundant (few)
(B.  Holtby,  unpublished  analyses).  Furthermore,  body  condition  of  adults  during  return
migration  (as  measured  by  body  length  and  weight,  physiological  and  genetic  indicators  of
fish health, and/or the presence of parasites) may provide an indication of en-route and pre-
spawning  mortalities,  and  hence  spawning  success.  Benchmarks  for  those  metrics  will  be
identified on a case-by-case basis where data exist.

3.2  Trends in spawners

We identified metrics of temporal trends in spawner abundances over the short term
(the  longer  of  three  generations  and  ten  years)  and  the  extent  of  changes  in  spawner
abundances over the long term (the historical record).  Analyses based on recent data may be
more  appropriate  if  long-term  climate  or  ecosystem  changes  prevent  a  CU  from  achieving
historical  unfished  levels.  On  the  other  hand,  those  recent  data  may  miss  harvest-induced
declines  that  have  occurred  over  several  decades,  which  are  captured  by  long-term  metrics.
To  identify  underlying  trends  in  spawner  abundances  independent  of  interannual  "noise"
(e.g.,  due  to  cyclic  recruitment  dynamics,  and  observation  and  assessment  errors),  spawner
abundances  were  log-transformed  and  then  smoothed  with  a  four-year  (or  one  generation)
running mean.

One possible lower benchmark derived from short-term linear trends (i.e., the slope,
or rate of change, of the line of best fit over recent years) is the linear trend associated with a
reduction in abundances of 25% over the longer of 3 generations and 10 years, a proportional
reduction that is lower than that resulting in a COSEWIC threatened listing (30% decline in
abundance  of  spawners  where causes  are  not  known  or  are  irreversible  (COSEWIC,  2006))
(e.g.,  Figure  6  for  one  example  CU,  Takla/Trembleur-  Early  Stuart  Run  sockeye  salmon).
One possible upper benchmark is the linear trend associated with a fraction (e.g., 3/5) of that
reduction (or, equivalently, a 15% reduction in abundance of spawners over the same period).
Uncertainty in the assessment of trends due to incomplete sampling of CUs can be quantified
using  Bayesian  estimation.  In  particular,  the  posterior  probability  distribution  of  the
magnitude of declines can be estimated. Rather than the maximum likelihood estimates of the
slope,  a  specified  percentile  (e.g.,  10th)  of  the  posterior  probability  distribution  will  better
reflect the degree of uncertainty in those declines (e.g., Appendix A; Fig. A 5). A benchmark
based  on  the  10th  percentile  of  the  slope  will  be  smaller  (representing  a  smaller  decline  in
spawner  abundances)  than  a  benchmark  that  ignores  uncertainty.  Alternatively,  sensitivity
analyses  can  be  used  to  assess  how  robust  the  results  are  to  the  inclusion  or  exclusion  of
counting locations with missing values.

25% decline over 3 generations (i.e., the lower benchmark). The maximum and
mean smoothed loge(S) values over the entire time series are shown on the right.

To  capture  long-term  changes  in  abundances,  Pestal  and  Cass  (2007)  suggest  two
metrics based on the ratio of the geometric mean of the current generation to two baselines:
the long-term geometric mean and the highest generational mean. In addition, they propose a
ratio of ½ to delineate populations of moderate and low status (i.e., Green and Amber zones),
and ¼ to delineate those of low and very low status (i.e., Amber and Red zones) based on a
qualitative evaluation of expert opinion. These, as well as other metrics of rates of change in
spawner  abundances  are  currently  under  evaluation  (Erin  Porszt,  School  of  Resource  and
Environmental Management, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, V5A1S6).

3.3  Distribution

When multiple populations exist within a CU, the status of the "network of spawning
groups" may be more important than the status of the aggregate or any individual population
(i.e.,  spawning  group).  In  particular,  the  long-term  viability  of  a  CU  may  depend  on  the
genetic,  habitat,  and  life-history  diversity  of  the  resident  fish,  because  that  diversity  will
provide the capacity for natural recolonization of populations that may be lost (McElhany et
al., 2006). Although CUs are defined as mutually interchangeable groups of wild salmon with
similar habitats, genetic structure, and ecological characteristics, some types and/or levels of
diversity  were  not  considered  in  CU  designation  (Holtby  and  Ciruna,  2007)  and  may  be
important  for  their  long-term  persistence.  For  example,  to  identify  boundaries  among  CUs,
habitats  were  classified  into  freshwater  and  marine  adaptive  zones  based  on  two  ecological
classification  schemes    that  considered  patterns  of  climate,  drainage  density,  gradient,
hydrological  characteristics,  connectivity,  marine  circulation  patterns  (e.g.,  fjords  and
straights),  among  other  factors  (Augerot  et  al.,  1999;  Ciruna  and  Butterfield,  2005).  Fine-
scale  features  of  habitats  such  as  patterns  of  stream,  lake,  and  wetland  morphology  and
drainage  basins  <  22,000  km2  were  not  considered  (Holtby  and  Ciruna,  2007),  but  may  be

  20

associated with adaptations of fish to their local environment (Kitanishi et al., 2009; Neville
et al., 2006; Tallman and Healey, 1994). The CU classification scheme also used information
on  genetic  population  structure  obtained  from  the  analysis  of  microsatellite  loci  in
hierarchical  classification  trees,  calculated  using  clustering  algorithms  (Terry  Beacham  and
the  Pacific  Biological  Station  Genetics  Lab,  Fisheries  and  Oceans  Canada,  Nanaimo,  B.C.,
V9T  6N7).  Although  the  maximum  number  of  levels  generated  in  the  hierarchical
classification trees was five, Holtby and Ciruna (2007) found that the third and fourth levels
captured the major population groupings. Genetic variability at finer scales (fourth and fifth
levels,  i.e.,  within  CUs)  may  represent  adaptive  and  heritable  diversity  if  that  variability  is
associated  with  phenotypic  or  life-history  traits.  Information  on  ecological  considerations
such  as  spawn  timing,  migration,  and  smolt  age  was  also  included  in  the  CU  classification
scheme  when  genetic  information  (to  the  level  considered  in  the  hierarchical  classification
trees)  suggested  CU  boundaries  that  differed  from  habitat-derived  boundaries.  Therefore,
variability  in  life-history  traits  associated  with  fine-scale  genetic  variability  (fourth  or  fifth
levels) was not considered, and may exist within CUs.

Although  monitoring  all  components  of  diversity  (habitat,  genetic,  and  ecological)
may  be  logistically  difficult,  indicators  of  distribution  that  use  data  on  the  arrangement,
habitat,  time  trends  in  abundance,  and  location  of  spawning  groups  may  provide  surrogate
measures  of  that  diversity.  We  have  identified  candidate  metrics  that  reflect  four  types  of
distribution:  (1)  distribution  of  spawners  among  spawning  groups  (or  counting  locations),
e.g., Walters and Cahoon (1985), (2) distribution of spawners among habitat types (McElhany
et al., 2006), (3) distribution in temporal trends, as described for Bristol Bay sockeye salmon
populations (Rogers and Schindler, 2008), and (4) spatial structure of spawning groups, e.g.,
distance between spawning groups (McElhany et al., 2006). The example metrics we present
are  preliminary;  further  work  is  currently  underway  to  identify  metrics  of  distribution  that
reflect  the  diversity  of  spawning  groups  within  CUs  (S.  Peacock  and  C.  Holt,  Pacific
Biological  Station,  Fisheries  and  Oceans  Canada).  Our  example  metrics  are  meant  to
supplement,  and  not  replace,  other  information  currently  available  on  genetic,  habitat,  and
ecological diversity within CUs.

3.3.1  Distribution of spawners among groups

Most  simply,  the  distribution  of  spawners  across  locations  can  be  measured  by  the
number  of  extant  locations  of  spawners  (one  metric  used  by  COSEWIC  to  assess
distributional status) (COSEWIC, 2006). Two additional metrics of spawner distribution are
the  number  of  spawning  groups  with  abundances  >100  fish  (e.g.,  Figure  7)  (or  the  number
with more than a certain percentage of the total spawner abundance to the CU, e.g., 5%), and
the number of groups that contain some percentage (e.g., 80%) of the total abundance when
ranked from most to least abundant. These metrics have an advantage over the simple count
of spawning groups, of differentiating CUs that have a number of equally abundant spawning
groups  from  those  with  a  single  dominant  group  and  a  number  of  very  small  groups.  For
highly concentrated CUs, when ranked from most to least abundant, the top 80% of the total
abundance will be comprised of only one spawning group; for dispersed CUs, that 80% will
consist of several (e.g.,  Figure  8).  Trends over time in distribution  may indicate changes in
the locations or spawners or alterations in spatial structure. However, care must be taken to

  21

ensure that apparent changes in distribution are due to changes in the status of the network of
spawning groups rather than inconsistent sampling coverage over time.

average over one generation or four years, t-2, t-1, t, and t+1) for the
Takla/Trembleur sockeye CU. The numbers inside the bars represent the minimum
number of counting locations required to make up 80% of the total abundance in
each generation.

An  alternative  metric  of  distribution  proposed  by  Walters  and  Cahoon  (1985)  is  the
cumulative  escapement  over  counting  locations  ranked  by  abundance  (e.g.,  Figure  9).  The
area  under  the  curve  (AUC)  of  that  relationship  reflects  the  degree  of  concentration  of
spawners among groups. CUs with highly equitable distributions (i.e., all spawning groups at
equal abundances) will have AUC values of 0.5 (representing a diagonal line from the origin
to  (1,1));  CUs  with  highly  concentrated  distributions  will  have  values  closer  to  1.0

  23

(representing a concave curve between the origin and (1,1) passing near (0,1)).  AUC values
of less than 0.5 are impossible due to the rank order of the X-axis.

In  addition,  the  Interior  Fraser  Coho  Recovery  Team  (2006)  provided  a  recovery
objective  for  the  distribution  of  coho  salmon  in  the  B.C.  interior:  generational  average
spawner abundances greater than 1000 fish for at least half of the sub-populations within each
of the five interior Fraser populations. Their target was derived from simulation modelling of
sockeye  salmon  (N.  Schubert,  Co-operative  Resource  Management  Institute,  Simon  Fraser
University,  Burnaby,  B.C.,  V5A  1S6,  unpublished  analyses)  and  other  salmon  species
(McElhany  et  al.,  2006),  with  the  overall  goal  of  ensuring  viability  of  the  entire  Interior
population of coho salmon.

3.3.2  Distribution of spawners among habitat types

CUs that cover a large spatial area with heterogeneous habitats may be associated with
the expression of a wider variety of life-history traits than those that cover only a small area
(or proportion of available habitat) or single habitat type and therefore may be better able to
respond to changes in environmental conditions (Busch et al., 2008; McElhany et al., 2006).
The extent of occurrence of a population and area of occupancy are included as IUCN Red
list criteria (IUCN, 2001) and COSEWIC listing criteria (COSEWIC, 2006). For example, an
area of occupancy of < 2 000 km2 will result in a "threatened" listing if the population is also
declining  or  fluctuating  (COSEWIC,  2006).  Without  a  decline  or  fluctuations,  an  area  of
occupancy of < 20 km is required for a "threatened" listing. Spatial extent of salmon within
CUs  can  also  be  captured  by  metrics  such  as  the  total  stream  length  available  to  spawners,
accounting for blockages to fish passage.

Potential  metrics  of  habitat  diversity  include  the  distribution  of  spawners  across
stream orders and the proportion of spawners using various microhabitats (e.g., beach versus
stream habitat,  for CUs that contain that fine-scale level of habitat diversity). Cooney et al.
(2007)  captured  habitat  diversity  with  the  proportion  of  spawners  occupying  different
ecoregions, which are classified by climate, soil, geology, vegetation and land-use (Cooney et
al.,  2007).  Due  to  overlap  with  Strategy  2  of  the  Wild  Salmon  Policy,  metrics  and
benchmarks on habitat type are not developed here.

3.3.3  Distribution of time-trends in spawner abundances

The  distribution  in  temporal  responses  of  spawning  groups  to  environmental  or
anthropogenic stressors may be associated with the capacity of a CU to persist over the long
term. A wide distribution of responses will be associated with an increased probability that at
least one spawning group will persist under future environmental conditions.  Variability in
responses to common disturbances has been observed in asynchronous trends in productivity
among  neighbouring  stocks  of  BC  and  Alaskan  Pacific  salmon  that  are  exposed  to  similar
conditions (Dorner et al., 2007; Rogers and Schindler, 2008). Those divergent responses may
be associated with fine-scale habitat (e.g., at the lake scale (Rogers and Schindler, 2008)) and
genetic  variability.  The  proportion  of  individual  spawning  groups  that  exceed  declines
associated  with  benchmarks  for  aggregate  spawners  (as  described  in  Section  3.2)  or  the
spread (range or standard deviation) in the slope of the linear trends can be used as metrics of
distribution in time trends (e.g., Figure 10).

smoothed with a four-year running mean for all counting locations (spawning
groups) within the Takla/Trembleur sockeye CU. Only counting locations with
<50% missing data points over the last 15 years were included. The linear rate of
change associated with 15% and 25% declines in abundances over three
generations are shown with dotted and dashed lines, respectively. 92.3% of
counting locations had rates of declines greater than those that associated with the
lower benchmark.

3.3.4  Spatial structure

Spatial structure of spawning groups within a CU reflects its vulnerability to a single
catastrophic  event  (e.g.,  a  flow  blockage)  and  the  likelihood  of  recolonization  of  locally
depleted groups (McElhany et al., 2006). Spawning groups that are highly aggregated may be
at  greater  risk  of  catastrophic  loss  due  to  single  stressor,  whereas  those  that  are  highly

  26

dispersed  may  experience  delayed  recolonization.  Qualitative  assessments  of  the  spatial
extent  and  arrangement  of  spawning  groups,  connectivity,  and  risk  of  catastrophe  will  be
valuable  when  considering  spatial  structure  (as  described  in  the  viability  criteria  for  ESA-
listed Pacific salmon stock in the U.S.) (Busch et al., 2008).

With the exception of the benchmark developed by the Interior Fraser Coho Recovery
Team  and  COSEWIC  criteria  (B  and  D),  we  do  not  provide  benchmarks  on  metrics  of
distribution because of a lack of theoretical basis and data to identify specific levels that will
result  in  reduced  production  and/or  increased  probabilities  of  extirpation.  Instead,  these
metrics provide an overall picture of the distributional properties of a CU, which may indicate
specific  questions  for  further  investigation.  For  example,  a  trend  towards  increasing
concentration of spawners may warrant examinations into the causes and specific geographic
location  of  the  changes  (e.g.,  is  the  trend  due to  an  increase  in  abundance  of  one  dominant
spawning group or to a loss of several weak spawning groups?).

3.4  Fishing mortality

Fishing rates assess intensity of fishing pressure and, in some cases where information
on  spawner  abundances  is  not  available,  benchmarks  based  on  them  may  be  more  easily
applied to management regulations than benchmarks on abundances. By maintaining fishing
rates below acceptable levels, it may be possible to restore and maintain healthy populations
without  measuring  spawner  abundances  directly.  Although  it  might  at  first  seem  prudent  to
use  FMSY  as  an  upper  benchmark  (delineating  Green  and  Amber  zones)  "to  provide,  on  an
average  annual  basis,  the  maximum  annual  catch  for  a  CU"  (Fisheries  and  Oceans  Canada,
2005) (p.18), the UN Agreement of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks
(1995) recommends FMSY be used as a "limit" or lower reference point. Furthermore, DFO's
Fisheries  Decision-Making  Framework  Incorporating  the  Precautionary  Approach  (2009)
recommends  that  fishing  mortalities  remain  below  FMSY.  To  be  consistent  with  those
initiatives and limit reference points used in other fisheries (e.g., Atlantic salmon as described
by  the  North  Atlantic  Salmon  Conservation  Organization,  and  U.S.  west  coast  groundfish,
Pacific  Fisheries  Management  Council),  we  suggest  using  FMSY  as  a  lower  benchmark
instead.  Upper  benchmarks  can  instead  be  derived  from  a  percentage  of  FMSY  (e.g.,  70%,  a
provisional  upper  benchmark  until  further  information  is  available).  Therefore,  although  a
lower benchmark on fishing mortality of FMSY may at first seem too precautionary (i.e., too
high) to be consistent with lower benchmarks on spawner abundances that are << SMSY (e.g.,
Sgen),  it  is  consistent  with  previous  management  experience  and  so  we  consider  it  as  a
candidate  lower  benchmark  here.  Note,  the  prioritization  or  weighting  of  conflicting
indicators of status will be an important next step, highlighted by this example.

If  estimates  of  FMSY  are  too  optimistic  (i.e.,  are  biased  upwards),  then  benchmarks
derived  from  those  estimates  may  allow  fishing  rates  to  be  higher  than  acceptable  levels.
Indeed, when derived from a Ricker spawner-recruitment relationship (Hilborn and Walters,
1992),  estimates  of  the  Ricker  a  parameter  and  hence  FMSY  are  usually  biased  upwards,
especially  when  time  series  of  data  are  short  (see  Table  6  for  FMSY  equation).  This  bias
results,  in  part,  from  measurement  errors  in  spawner  abundances  and  lack  of  independence
between spawner and recruitment data (Walters and Martell, 2004). To reduce biases in FMSY,

  27

a values can be estimated independently of the stock-recruitment relationships, from the mean
loge(R/S) observed historically (Gibson and Myers, 2004). Although that approximation will
underestimate  the  true  value  (and  hence  FMSY),  it  can  set  a  useful  lower  bound.  A  newly
developed  approach  for  estimating  stock-recruitment  parameters  that  avoids  many  of  the
biases  described  above,  uses  time-series  analysis  to  derive  annual  estimates  of  loge(R/S)
residuals  that  are  shared  among  neighbouring  stocks.  That  approach  has  been  applied  to
Skeena River sockeye salmon to estimate benchmarks for management (Walters et al., 2008),
but has yet to be rigorously tested in a simulation model.

Alternative lower benchmarks on fishing mortality include the slope at the origin of
the  stock-recruitment  relationship  (FMAX,  as  suggested  by  Mace  (1993)  (i.e.,  the  maximum
log-transformed  recruits-per-spawner  at  low  spawner  abundances),  the  median  log-
transformed recruits-per-spawner (FMED, as suggested by Sissenwine  and  Shepherd (1987)),
and  the  slope  at  the  origin  of  the  smolt-recruitment  relationship,  a  benchmark  that  is
independent of variability in freshwater survival (Bradford et al., 2000).

We suggest fishing mortality relative to productivity as an indicator of status because

it may detect unsustainable (high) fishing rates that may result in stock depletion. Although
fishing mortalities greater than the lower benchmark will indicate that, if maintained, the
fishing mortality may result in a threatened listing by COSEWIC (i.e., status in the Red zone),
the converse is not necessarily true. Fishing mortalities below the lower benchmark may

  28

result from reduced fishing pressure on severely depleted or commercially unviable stocks.
Indeed, marine survival of several populations of North Coast salmon are below replacement
despite near zero fishing mortality, suggesting the Green status on that metric for those CUs
may be inappropriate as an overall indicator of status. Furthermore, historical time series on
survival may be inappropriate for estimating productivity when parameters are time-varying
(i.e., historical conditions are not representative of current conditions). Where possible,
marine survival should be estimated annually from smolt abundances or fry abundances and
recruitment to better inform current estimates of productivity.

We recommend that assessment on this metric be considered in combination with

known management decisions and other indicators of status (e.g., trends in abundances and
distribution) to distinguish among possible reasons for the observed status.  Other
anthropogenic stressors are considered in other strategies of the WSP (e.g., habitat
modification under Strategy 2).

3.5  Incorporating uncertainties into assessments

3.5.1  A qualitative approach for incorporating uncertainties

To  evaluate  the  degree  of  uncertainty  in  observed  data  when  assessing  status  of
sockeye salmon stocks in the Fraser River, Pestal and Cass (2007) proposed five categories of
data  quantity  and  quality  based  on  the  number  of  years  with  observations  of  spawner
abundance  and  methods  for  collecting  data  (e.g.,  visual  surveys,  fence  counts,  and  mark-
recapture  experiments).  Crawford  and  Rumsey  (2009)  suggest  an  alternative  classification
scheme based in part, on the number of sub-populations within an assessment unit (e.g., CU)
for which data is available. We have adapted those schemes to classify the data on spawner
abundances  and  recruitment  into  three  zones:  Green  (low  uncertainties),  Amber,  (moderate
uncertainties),  and  Red  (high  uncertainties),  using  criteria  described  in  Table  7.    Those
guidelines may be further adapted to the specific characteristics of data in each CU.

 < 50% of years with observations in
the last 3 generations or < 50% of years
with observations in the last generation
  Harvested in a multi-stock fishery
where catch cannot be easily attributed

Uncertainties in the data used to assess status may influence the overall assessment of
a CU. For example, a CU that has a biological status in the Amber zone, but an uncertainty
status  in  the  Red  zone  may  warrant  an  overall  status  of  Red.  One  simple  approach  to
combining information on biological status and uncertainty in the data is a two-dimensional
assessment  rule,  as  described  in  Figure  11.  Although  conceptually  simple  and  easy  to
implement,  this  approach  considers  measurement  errors  only  (and  not  natural  variability,

  30

errors  in  estimating  benchmarks,  or  variability  in  outcomes  of  implementing  fishing
regulations),  and  does  not  evaluate  the  implications  of  those  errors  on  the  probability  of
extirpation  over  the  long-term  or  probability  of  recovery  to  a  target  in  the  short  term.
Alternatively,  a  simulation  modelling  approach  explicitly  accounts  for  all  major  sources  of
uncertainties  in  a  quantitative  way  and  can  evaluate  the  impacts  of  those  uncertainties  on
probabilistic performance criteria.

3.5.2  Simulation modelling to incorporate uncertainties and evaluate lower

benchmarks

Using a Monte Carlo simulation model, we evaluated benchmarks from two classes of
indicators,  spawner  abundances  and  fishing  mortality,  on  two  probabilistic  performance
criteria: the probability of extirpation over 100 years and probability of recovery to a target
(SMSY)  in  one  (or  three)  generations.  That  simulation  model  is  described  in  the  technical
documentation  on  the  Evaluation  of  Benchmarks  for  Conservation  Units  in  Canada's  Wild
Salmon Policy (Holt, 2009); only a brief summary of the methods and results is given here. In
particular, we compared the performance of lower benchmarks on spawner abundances along

  31

a gradient in size (from 10-90% of recruitment MSY (RMSY, i.e., recruitment at SMSY), to three
others  that  have  been  cited  in  the  scientific  literature  or  have  been  suggested  for  managing
Pacific  fisheries:  spawner  abundance  at  50%  of  RMAX,  40%  of  SMSY,  and  Sgen,  the  spawner
abundance  that  will  result  in  recovery  to  SMSY  within  one  generation  under  equilibrium
conditions.    In  addition,  we  compared  the  performance  of  lower  benchmarks  on  fishing
mortality  along  a  gradient  in  size  (from  50%  to  150%  of  FMSY),  to  two  others  from  the
literature, FMAX (maximum log-transformed recruits-per-spawner at low spawner abundances)
and  FMED  (median  log-transformed  recruits-per-spawner).  For  both  classes  of  indicators,  we
evaluated  performance  under  a  pessimistic  (aggressive)  management  scenario,  while  still
recognizing  the  lower  benchmarks.  For  benchmarks  on  spawner  abundance,  we  applied  a
constant  escapement  policy  equivalent  to  the  lower  benchmark.  For  benchmarks  on  fishing
mortality,  we  applied  a  constant  fishing  mortality  rule  equivalent  to  the  lower  benchmark.
Our  examples  represent  the  worst-case  scenario  (i.e.,  high  fishing  effort  and  therefore  high
probability  of  extirpation  and  low  probability  of  recovery);  other  harvest  rules  where
escapement  or  harvest  rates  are  adjusted  according  to  observed  spawner  abundances  or
catches,  will  be  associated  with  improved  performance  (reduced  probability  of  extirpation
and  increased  probability  of  recovery).  Evaluating  alternative  harvest  control  rules  in  a
simulation  model  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  report,  but  will  be  necessary  before
implementing those rules in the fishery.

For  metrics  of  spawner  abundances,  we  found  that  the  lower  benchmark,  Sgen,  was
associated  with  a  relatively  low  probability  of  extirpation  (probability  <25%;  risk
classification  adapted  from  DFO's  "Fishery  decision-making  framework  incorporating  the
Precautionary  Approach"  (2009))  over  100  years  for  populations  with  equilibrium
abundances > 15,000 fish, and high probability of recovery to SMSY within three generations
(probability >75%) after accounting for uncertainties in all major components of the fishery
system. Furthermore, the probabilities of extirpation over 100 years for Sgen were more robust
to variability in stock productivity compared with benchmarks calculated from proportions of
SMSY.  For  metrics  of  fishing  mortality,  the  lower  benchmark  FMSY  was  associated  with  a
relatively  low  probability  of  extirpation  (probability  <25%)  over  100  years  for  populations
with equilibrium abundances > 30,000, and high probability of recovery to SMSY within three
generations (probability >75%), and its performances was more robust to variability in stock
productivity than other benchmarks on fishing mortality derived from the scientific literature.

Although  simulation  modelling  has  been  embraced  as  a  methodology  for  evaluating
probabilistic outcomes to inform management decision (e.g., probability of extirpation (Dulvy
et  al.,  2004)),  the  outputs  of  those  models  are  highly  sensitive  to  assumptions  about  model
structure  and  parameter  values.  Mace  et  al.  (2008)  suggest  that  simulation  models  of
population  viability  are  more  valuable  for  assessing  relative  performance  of  possible
management  decisions  (e.g.,  evaluating  performance  of  various  benchmarks  relative  to  one
another  or  performance  of  a  single  benchmarks  under  various  assumptions  about  model
structure  or  parameterization)  than  for  identifying  the  absolute  probability  of  a  specified
outcome. We therefore recommend evaluating benchmarks on their relative performance and
their sensitivity to model assumptions, in addition to (and perhaps with reduced emphasis on)
absolute performance.

  32

Based on our simulation model results, sensitivity analyses, and the preliminary risk
classification  scheme  adapted  from  DFO's  Decision-Making  Framework  (2009),  we
recommend  a  lower  benchmark  on  spawner  abundances  derived  from  Sgen,  and  a  lower
benchmark on fishing mortality equivalent to FMSY. Sgen was also chosen by the BC Ministry
of  the  Environment  as  a  limit  reference  point  (a  level  of  abundance  "that  defines  a  highly
undesired  state"  (Johnston  et  al.,  2002)(p.4))  for  steelhead,  Oncorhynchus  mykiss,  based  on
the  results  of  a  similar  simulation  modelling  exercise.  In  the  absence  of  data  on  stock
productivity  to  calculate  Sgen,  the  lower  benchmark,  20%  of  carrying  capacity,  or  spawner
abundances  at  maximum  recruitment,  can  be  used  as  a  proxy  (Johnston  et  al.,  2002).  That
recommendation  differs  from  that  of  earlier  analyses  due  to  additional  results  showing
reduced  sensitivity  of  Sgen  to  a  wide  range  in  possible  future  productivities.  The  choice  of
FMSY  as  a  lower  benchmark  on  fishing  mortality  is  consistent  with  the  recommendation  of
FMSY  as  a  "limit  reference  point"  by  the  UN  Straddling  Fish  Stocks  and  Highly  Migratory
Fish Stocks Agreement (1995). However, these recommendations on lower benchmarks will
need to be re-evaluated once the risk tolerances of stakeholders are identified. One caveat of
our simulations analyses is that the results apply to CUs where recruitment is derived from a
stock-recruitment  relationship.  For  some  CUs,  recruitment  levels  have  been  consistently
below replacement, suggesting stock-recruitment models do not apply and benchmarks based
on  them  are  inappropriate.  In  those  cases,  we  suggest  deriving  status  from  trends  in
abundances  and  distribution  over  time,  current  estimates  of  productivity,  and  abundances
relative to freshwater estimates of capacity (but those capacity estimates will be insensitive to
changes in marine carrying capacity and survival).

3.6  Non-stationarity

Non-stationarity  is  pervasive  in  fisheries  systems.  Temporal  variability  in  biological
processes  and  the  parameters  that  describe  them  are  driven  by  changes  in  physical  and
ecological conditions related to anthropogenic and natural stressors. Benchmarks that require
long  time  series  of  historical  data  may  not  represent  thresholds  for  current  conditions.  In
scenarios  dominated  by  non-stationarity,  metrics  reflecting  recent  trends  in  abundances  or
distribution over time, or current estimates of fishing mortality and productivity, may better
reflect status than those that use stock-recruitment models based on historical data.

3.7  Data requirements

The application of indicators, metrics, and benchmarks to individual CUs will depend
in  part  on  data  availability  (Table  8).  For  example,  when  time  series  of  spawner  and
recruitment  data  are  available,  status  can  be  assessed  from  current  estimates  of  spawner
abundances and benchmarks derived from the spawner-recruitment relationship. When those
time  series  are  not  available,  spawner  abundances  may  be  assessed  relative  to  independent
estimates  of  capacity.  Furthermore,  when  current  estimates  of  spawner  abundances  are  not
available,  it  may  be  possible  to  assess  status  from  fishing  mortality  relative  to  estimates  of
productivity. Except in a few CUs with high quality data, it will not be possible to apply the
full suite of metrics and benchmarks to assess status.

4.  APPLICATION OF BENCHMARKS TO TWO EXAMPLE CUs

4.1  Takla/Trembleur sockeye salmon

4.1.1  Data

Spawner  abundances  for  Takla/Trembleur  (Early  Stuart)  sockeye  were  estimated
using a combination of visual surveys (ground and aerial, 41 streams 1950-2008, each with
between  one  and  59  years  of  data)  and  a  fence  count  at  Dust  Creek.  Visual  estimates  of
abundance  were  expanded  to  total  annual  abundances  using  a  multiplication  factor
estimated from the fence count. Assessment methods have been consistent since 1987 when
the fence was introduced, though refinements to the expansion factor have occurred since
then.  All  visual  estimates  prior  to  1987  have  been  expanded  to  total  abundances  (data
available  from  Keri  Benner,  Fisheries  and  Oceans  Canada,  985  McGill  Place,  Kamloops,
B.C., V2C 6X6).

The optimum escapement of Takla and Trembleur lakes (number of adult spawners
required  to  fully  use  the  rearing  capacity)  was  estimated  to  be  779  000  fish  based  on  the
relationship  between  seasonally  averaged  photosynthetic  rate  and  juvenile  sockeye
production (Shortreed et al., 2001).

Estimates of sockeye recruitment to Takla and Trembleur lakes were derived from
the Early Stuart run-timing group of the Fraser River (return years 1953 through 2007) (K.
Forrest,  Pacific  Salmon  Commission,  600-1155  Robson  St.,  Vancouver,  BC.,  V6E  1B5,
pers. comm.), since that run-timing group is composed primarily of fish returning to those
two  lakes.  Takla  and  Trembleur  lakes  contributed  >99.9%  of  total  escapement  for  Early
Stuarts in all years except 1972 in which Takla and Trembleur fish comprised 98.6% of the
total  (K.  Benner,    pers.  comm.).  Recruitment  estimates  include  the  sum  of  spawning
escapement,  en-route  mortality,  and  catch  from  marine  and  in-river  commercial  fisheries,
marine  and  in-river  test  fisheries,  Fraser  River  First  Nations  harvests,  and  recreational
fisheries (Pacific Salmon Commission, 2001).

4.1.2  Indicators of status

Spawner abundances

Parameters  of  the  stock-recruitment  relationship  were  estimated  in  a  Bayesian
context with a normally distributed prior on the carrying capacity, i.e., spawner abundances
at RMAX (mean of the prior derived from Shortreed et al. (2001) (Appendix A, Fig. A 1 and
Fig. A 2). The median of the posterior distribution varied by <10 000 fish when a uniform
prior  was  used  (dotted  line,  Fig.  A  2)  instead  of  an  informative  prior,  suggesting  that  the
posterior distribution was only weakly influenced by the prior, and conversely was strongly
influenced  by  the  data.  We  used  Markov  Chain  Monte  Carlo  methods  to  generate  the
posterior distribution for model parameters. Upper benchmarks on SMSY, 80% of SMSY, and
40%  of  carrying  capacity  were  estimated  to  be  396,000;  316,000;  and  312,000  fish,
respectively. The lower benchmarks, Sgen and 20% of carrying capacity were estimated at
118,000  and  156,000  fish,  respectively.  Additional  benchmarks  described  in  Section  3.1

  36

and recommended previously by fisheries management or the scientific literature, were also
calculated  for  comparison.  Values  for  the  alternative  lower  benchmarks  ranged  from  137
000  (S  at  50%  of  RMSY)  to  170,000  (90th  percentile  of  S  at  50%·RMSY,  a  precautionary
estimate of that value given uncertainty in the underlying data). The 90th percentile of SMSY,
a precautionary estimate of the upper benchmark, SMSY, was almost twice as large as SMSY
itself (746,000 instead of 396,000). The current estimate of spawner abundances (2008) and
generational mean (2005-2008) (29,835 and 27,371 fish respectively) fell below all lower
(and  upper)  benchmarks  for  this  class  of  indicators.  The  statuses  of  Takla/Trembleur
sockeye salmon on this and the remaining classes of indicators are described in more detail
in Appendix A.

Trends in spawners

Recent declines in spawner abundances were larger than those designated by most
lower benchmarks (Figure 6). The probability that the slope of decline exceeded the lower
benchmark  was  <0.001  (Fig.  A  5).  However,  over  the  long  term,  the  declines  were
relatively  small.  In  fact,  the  ratio  of  the  geometric  mean  spawner  abundance  to  the  long-
term mean was greater than the upper benchmark, resulting in Green status on that metric.

Distribution

The number of spawning groups consisting of >100 fish declined from 37 in 1993-
1996 to 35 in 2005-2008 for this CU (Figure 7). Ten spawning groups comprised the top
80% of total spawners in the most recent generation (2005-2008) (Figure 8). 68% of
spawning groups currently have geometric mean spawner abundances that exceed 1000 fish
(i.e., greater than the 50% threshold of the Interior Fraser Coho Recovery Team (2006)).
The area under the curve (AUC) of the relationship between ranked spawner group and
cumulative proportion of total spawners declined from 0.75 in 1993-1996 to 0.68 in the
most recent generation (2005-2008) (i.e., the distribution is now more dispersed; Figure 9).
That AUC values have decreased since 1993-1996, in large part due to the steep decline in
one dominant spawning group, Driftwood, in the mid-1990s.

The  slopes  of  the  linear  changes  in  log-transformed  spawner  abundances  over  the
most current three generations ranged from -0.84 to +0.24 among spawning groups, 92% of
which had declines that were below the lower benchmark associated with a 25% reduction
in abundances (Figure 10). When only locations with no missing values were included, that
percentage was 91%.

To  assess distribution of spawners  across spatial locations  and  habitat  types in the
Takla/Trembleur CU, further investigations are required in coordination with Strategy 2 of
the Wild Salmon Policy.

Fishing mortality

Both  the  most  recent  estimate  of  fishing  mortaliy  (F  =  0.0791  or  equivalently,
harvest rate = 7.6%, 2007) and the most recent generational mean (F =0.176, harvest rate =
16.1%)  fell  in  the  Green  zone,  i.e.,  below  all  upper  (and  lower)  benchmarks.  Fishing
mortalities have been relatively low in this CU since the mid 1990s.

4.2  Hecate Strait Lowlands odd-year pink salmon

4.2.1  Data

Spawner  abundances  for  Hecate  Strait  Lowlands  odd-year  pink  salmon  have  been
estimated at 175 counting locations using visual ground surveys (1951 through 2005,  data
available from the NuSEDS database at the Pacific Biological Station, Fisheries and Oceans
Canada, Nanaimo, B.C.). Although some information on relative abundances exist prior to
1950,  in  many  cases  those  data  are  qualitative.    Estimates  of  spawner  abundances  from
1950 until 1998 are highly uncertain due to changes in survey effort and personnel over that
period,  the  absence  of  counting  fences  to  standardize  observed  numbers,  and  the  lack  of
documentation  on  multiplication  factors  used  to  expand  observed  numbers  to  total
abundances (Brian Spilsted, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 417 - 2nd Avenue West, Prince
Rupert, B.C., V8J 1G8, pers. comm.). Since 1998, area-under-the-curve analyses have been
used to estimate total spawners from observed abundances and run-timing, and the details
of those methods have been recorded.

4.2.2  Indicators of status:

Spawner abundances

We were not able to identify benchmarks on spawner abundances for this CU for at
least three reasons: catch data (and hence recruitment) have not yet been compiled due to
difficulties in assigning area-wide catches to specific CUs, freshwater capacity is unknown,
and stock-recruitment relationships have not been estimated.

Trends in spawners

The  rate  of  change  in  log-transformed  spawner  abundances  aggregated  over  all
counting  locations  was  positive  over  the  last  ten  years,  warranting  a  green  status  on  that
metric  (Appendix  B,  Fig.  B  1).  The  probabilities  that  the  true  rate  of  change  in  log-
transformed  spawner  abundances  was  less  than  the  upper  and  lower  benchmarks  (rate  of
change associated with 15% and 25% reduction in abundances, respectively) were less than
the candidate threshold of 10%, (6.6% and 8.1%, respectively) warranting a Green status on
that  metric  (Appendix  B,  Fig.  B  2).  Status  was  also  Green  for  the  metric  describing  the
long-term  extent  of  changes  in  spawner  abundances  (ratios  of  current  geometric  mean
spawner abundance over the current generation to the historical mean and maximum).

Distribution

The number of spawning groups consisting of >100 fish increased from 33 in 1995
to  71  in  2001,  and  then  declined  to  34  in  2005  (Appendix  B,  Fig.  B  3).  The  top  80%  of
ranked spawner abundances was comprised of eleven spawning groups in 2005 (Appendix
B,  Fig.  B  4).  Of  the  counting  groups  that  were  observed  in  2005  (the  most  current  year),
79%  had  geometric  mean  spawner  abundances  that  exceeded  1000  fish  (i.e.,  greater  than
the 50% threshold of the Interior Fraser Coho Recovery Team (2006)).  The area under the
curve of the relationship between ranked spawner group and cumulative proportion of total
spawners was the same in 2005 as in 1995 (0.115) (Appendix B, Fig. B 5).

Linear rates of change in loge-transformed spawner abundances over the most recent
ten years ranged from -0.77 to +0.95, and 28.8% of spawning groups had declines that were
below that associated with the lower benchmark (reduction in abundances > 25% over the
time period) (Appendix B, Fig. B 6). When only locations with no missing values over the
10-year period were included, that percentage was 7.7%.

As  for  the  Takla/Trembleur  sockeye  CU,  further  studies  are  required  to  assess

distribution of spawners across spatial locations and habitat types in this CU.

Fishing mortality

We were not able to assess status on fishing mortality for this CU because catch data

have not yet been compiled, as described in the "Spawner abundances" sub-section above.

Uncertainties

The estimates of spawner abundances are highly uncertain because visual estimates
have  not  been  calibrated  with  absolute  numbers  (e.g.,  from  fence  counts),  field  and
analytical  methods  of  assessment  have  varied  over  time,  and  those  changes  are  not  well
documented.  In  addition,  time  series  of  catches  have  not  been  estimated,  in  part  due  to
difficulties in assigning area-wide catches to CUs.

5.  NEXT STEPS

In  order  to  evaluate  biological  status  of  CUs,  we  recommend  that  the  following

steps be taken.

(1) Develop qualitative guidelines for assessing status on the distribution of spawning

groups within CUs (the third class of indicators).

(2) Develop a stock assessment methodology to combine status on all classes of

indicators and measures of uncertainty.

(3) Where possible, reconstruct catch time series and compile recruitment data by CU.
(4) Evaluate status using benchmarks selected above and data compiled in step (3) for
all CUs. This step will be performed by staff within each area, with guidance from
Science branch.

  39

(5) Consider alternative risk classification schemes associated with risk tolerances

identified by stakeholders.

This  document  provides  methodological  background  to  perform  those  next  steps,  but
several  challenges  remain.  In  particular,  we  provide  a  multi-dimensional  assessment  of
status  on  four  classes  of  indicators,  but  fisheries  management  may  prefer  a  single  overall
assessment to inform decision making. Rules can be established to prioritize and combine
data  across  metrics,  but  that  integration  will  result  in  a  substantial  loss  of  information.
"Multi-attribute  analysis"  is  a  field  of  decision  analysis  that  developed  in  the  1970s  to
address  this  challenge  (Keeney  and  Raiffa,  1976).  It  has  been  applied  extensively  to
resource management (Herath and Prato, 2006; Nair and Sicherman, 1980) and could used
to combine information across metrics of status. A second challenge will be evaluating the
status  of  CUs  for  which  we  have  no  or  little  information.  One  possible  approach  is  to
integrate information across neighbouring CUs that are believed to have similar dynamics,
responses  to  stressors,  and  status.  Combining  that  information  can  be  done  quantitatively
(e.g.,  using  hierarchical  models  or  meta-analyses),  or  qualitatively.  When  integrating
information  over  numerous  CUs,  the  risks  of  overlooking  a  CU  that  may  have  diverging
status on one or several indicators will need to be weighed against logistical difficulties of
collecting  data  from  all  CUs  on  all  dimensions  of  status.  Finally,  a  preliminary  status
overview  of  all  CUs  may  be  required  before  data  on  CU-specific  catch  and/or  fishing
mortality are available to assess status and identify benchmarks on all classes of indicators.
For  CUs  with  high-quality  spawner  data,  a  preliminary  assessment  based  on  spawner
abundances relative to estimates of freshwater capacity, time trends in spawner abundances,
and/or distribution of spawners among counting locations may be valuable. Although these
indicators will only provide a partial assessment of CU status, it will be a first step towards
a complete assessment, and may highlight priority CUs where further analyses and/or data
are required.

Spawners at maximum recruitment (10 000s fish)

Fig.  A  2.  Probability  density  of  the  prior  distribution  (curve)  and  posterior  distribution
(bars)  of  spawner  abundances  at  maximum  recruitment  for  Takla/Trembleur
sockeye  salmon  derived  from  Bayesian  estimation  (MCMC  sampling,
n=1,000,000 Monte Carlo trials, thinned every 400 to remove autocorrelation
in the chain) of the stock-recruitment relationship. The dashed vertical line is
the mean of the prior distribution, the dotted line is the median of the posterior
estimate  of  carrying  capacity  assuming  a  uniform  prior  (i.e.,  a  relatively
uninformative  prior),  and  the  solid  line  is  the  median  of  the  posterior
distribution  including  prior  information.    The  mean  of  the  prior  distribution
corresponds  to  the  spawners  at  maximum  smolt  production  estimated  from
freshwater  production  studies  (77.9  104  fish).  The  spread  (i.e.,  standard
deviation)  of  the  prior  was  chosen  to  envelope  the  minimum  and  maximum
observed spawner abundances from 1991 through 2000 (33.2 104 and 108.6
104 fish, respectively, Shortreed et al. 2001).
