Sustainable Fisheries Framework

Backgrounder – A fishery decision-making framework incorporating

the precautionary approach

Introduction

This paper describes a general fishery decision-making framework  for

1

implementing a harvest strategy that incorporates the Precautionary

Approach (PA (Precautionary Approach)). The framework applies where

decisions on harvest strategies or harvest rates for a stock must be taken

on an annual basis or other time frame to determine Total Allowable Catch

or other measures to control harvests. The framework applies to key

harvested stocks managed by Fisheries and Oceans Canada; that is, those

stocks that are the specific and intended targets of a fishery, whether in a

commercial, recreational or subsistence fishery. In applying the framework,

all removals of these stocks from all types of fishing must be taken into

account. While application of this framework to key harvested stocks is the

minimum requirement, it may be applied more broadly to other stocks

where necessary and as circumstances warrant.

This decision framework is one part of an overall Sustainable Fisheries

Framework for Canadian fisheries, which includes a number of other

policies and initiatives, completed or being developed, such as a Forage

Species policy and a Sensitive Benthic Areas policy that together will

provide a more rigorous and comprehensive approach to managing

Canada’s fisheries, factoring in ecosystem considerations and precaution.

The Sustainable Fisheries Framework applies, and all the policies pursuant

to it apply, to fishery decisions on a stock by stock basis. This paper begins

with background on the PA (Precautionary Approach) in Canadian fisheries

then describes the elements of the decision framework and considerations

for applying it in a fishery.

The Precautionary Approach in Canadian Fisheries

In resource management, the PA (Precautionary Approach) is, in general,

about being cautious when scientific information is uncertain, unreliable or

inadequate and not using the absence of adequate scientific information as

a reason to postpone or fail to take action to avoid serious harm to the

resource.

The United Nations Agreement on Straddling and Highly Migratory Fish

Stocks (UNFA) , which came into force in 2001, commits Canada to use the

2

PA (Precautionary Approach) in managing straddling stocks as well as, in

effect, domestic stocks. In 2003, the Privy Council Office, on behalf of the

Government of Canada published a framework applicable to all federal

government departments that set out guiding principles for the application

of precaution to decision making about risks of serious or irreversible harm

where there is a lack of full scientific certainty.

3

In 2004, the Atlantic Fisheries Policy Review (AFPR (Atlantic Fisheries Policy

Review)) led by DFO (Fisheries and Oceans) called for a comprehensive risk

management framework for decision-making, which incorporated the PA

(Precautionary Approach) and included the following elements:

reference points linked to stock and ecosystem indicators;

objectives for desirable resource and fishery outcomes; and

resource use strategies to scale resource use to its condition in a

manner that avoids undesirable outcomes

One of the main drivers for the AFPR (Atlantic Fisheries Policy Review)

recommendation on conservation was the stock declines that have

occurred in recent decades in some groundfish fisheries.

In June 2005, DFO (Fisheries and Oceans) adopted the Wild Salmon Policy

for Pacific salmon , which incorporates a precautionary approach to

4

decision-making. In May 2006, DFO (Fisheries and Oceans) Science released

a paper outlining the minimal requirements, from a science perspective, for

a harvest strategy to be compliant with the Precautionary Approach.

Components of the General Decision Framework

6

The following are the primary components of the generalized framework:

1. Reference points and stock status zones (Healthy, Cautious and

Critical). Table 1 illustrates the three stock status zones and includes

generalized criteria for management actions for key harvested stocks.

2. Harvest strategy and harvest decision rules.

3. The need to take into account uncertainty and risk when developing

reference points and developing and implementing decision rules.

Reference Points and Stock Status Zones

The stock status zones are created by defining the Limit Reference Point

(LRP (Limit Reference Point)) at the Critical:Cautious zone boundary, and an

Upper Stock Reference Point (USR (Upper Stock Reference Point)) at the

Cautious:Healthy zone boundary and the Removal Reference for each of

the three zones. The three-zoned diagram below shows these different

elements.

The LRP (Limit Reference Point) represents the stock status below which

serious harm is occurring to the stock. At this stock status level, there may

also be resultant impacts to the ecosystem, associated species and a long-

term loss of fishing opportunities. Several approaches for calculating the

LRP (Limit Reference Point) are in use and may be refined over time. The

units describing stock status will vary depending on the nature of the

resource (groundfish, shellfish, salmonids or marine mammals). The LRP

(Limit Reference Point) is based on biological criteria and established by

Science through a peer reviewed process.

Under this framework, the USR (Upper Stock Reference Point) can perform

two functions. First, in accordance with SAR 2006-023 the USR (Upper Stock

Reference Point) is the stock level threshold below which removals must be

progressively reduced in order to avoid reaching the LRP (Limit Reference

Point). For this reason, under this framework, the USR (Upper Stock

Reference Point), at minimum, must be set at an appropriate distance

above the LRP (Limit Reference Point) to provide sufficient opportunity for

the management system to recognize a declining stock status and

sufficient time for management actions to have effect. Secondly, the USR

(Upper Stock Reference Point) can be a target reference point (TRP (Target

Reference Point)) determined by productivity objectives for the stock,
7

broader biological considerations  and social and economic objectives for

the fishery.

8

 A TRP (Target Reference Point) is a required element under

UNFA and in the FAO guidance on the application of the PA (Precautionary

Approach), as well as ecocertification standards based on it, such those of

the Marine Stewardship Council and may also be desirable in other

situations.

In practice, the threshold point below which removals must be reduced to

avoid serious harm (USR (Upper Stock Reference Point)) can be different

than the TRP (Target Reference Point). However, it is essential that while

socio-economic factors may influence the location of the USR (Upper Stock

Reference Point), these factors must not diminish its minimum function in

guiding management of the risk of approaching the LRP (Limit Reference

Point). In either case, the USR (Upper Stock Reference Point) would be

developed by fishery managers informed by consultations with the fishery

and other interests, with advice and input from Science. As an illustration,

the diagram below shows the TRP (Target Reference Point) as distinct from

the USR (Upper Stock Reference Point).

For many stocks, setting the LRP (Limit Reference Point) and USR (Upper

Stock Reference Point), as well as a TRP (Target Reference Point), in

biomass terms is suitable, but other units (such as escapement for salmon,

or yield for effort controlled fisheries) may be used to indicate stock status

where appropriate. In data deficient cases, priority should go to monitoring

the stock and establishing data time series to support the identification of

an LRP (Limit Reference Point). When developing reference points efforts

should be made to take into consideration the range of factors which may

affect the productivity of the stock including changes in ocean conditions,

where information is available.

The Removal reference is the maximum acceptable removal rate for the

stock. It is normally expressed in terms of fishing mortality (F) or harvest

rate. It could be described in ways other than F or harvest rate but it always

must be described in terms of fishery-related pressure that affects the

overall stock. The Removal reference includes all mortality from all types of

fishing. To comply with the UNFA, the Removal reference must be less than

or equal to the removal rate associated with maximum sustainable yield.

Both the previous diagrams illustrate how the Removal reference would be

adjusted depending on the stock’s abundance and its location in the three

stock status zones. In the Cautious zone, the adjustment of the Removal

reference does not have to follow a linear relationship as shown in the

diagram but a progressive reduction in removals is required.

Reference points will usually be determined using standard biomass and

harvest metrics. However, for a number of stocks, such measurements are

not available. In these cases, precautionary management actions should be

based on the estimates of productive potential and harvest that are the

most appropriate for the stock of concern and data available, with the

objective of avoiding serious harm to reproductive capacity of the stock.

Annex 1a elaborates on the cases where other indicators are used as

reference points for a particular stock or fishery. Such actions aiming at

conserving reproductive capacity could include the use of minimum harvest

sizes (above size at first maturity), gear restrictions, and/or temporal or

local closures. In these cases, reference points could be based on empirical

measurements of reproductive potential (e.g. minimum egg per recruit for

lobster).

Harvest Rate Strategy and Harvest Decision Rules

A harvest rate strategy is the approach taken to manage the harvest of a

stock and is a necessary element of any fishery plan. In order to implement

the PA (Precautionary Approach) in a fishery, pre-agreed harvest decision

rules and management actions for each zone, are essential components of

a harvest rate strategy.

Table 1 provides generalized management actions to apply this decision

framework to the management of key harvested stocks.  Actual harvest

decision rules should be more precise and provide details on the harvest

rates and possibly other management procedures that are required in each

zone or steps within a zone. The pre-agreed harvest decision rules and

management actions should vary in relation to the reference points, and be

designed to achieve the desired outcome by affecting the removal rate. The

removal rate should take into account total removals from all fisheries.

They should be expressed in terms appropriate for the management

system (e.g. effort controls for an effort based management system) and

do not need to be expressed in the same units as the LRP (Limit Reference

Point), USR (Upper Stock Reference Point) or Removal reference.

Specific values for individual stock harvest strategies are to be provided

through science assessments. The development of decision rules is a

Management responsibility and Science’s role is to provide advice in

support of their development. The harvest rate strategy, along with its

associated harvest rules, would take the form of a table and/or graph that

should be appended to the decision-making framework for each stock.

Annex 2a shows a general example of a harvest rate strategy for a fictional

stock.

This framework provides guidance on developing reference points

and harvest decision rules for key harvested targets stocks. However, the

application of the harvest decision rules in a fishery may need to be

tempered to limit effects on other stocks. Management actions related to

other ecosystem elements may also be considered when using the

decision-making framework based on available information.

Uncertainty and Risk

An important aspect of this decision framework is the treatment of

uncertainty and risk when estimating stock status, reference points and in
making and implementing management decisions. 9

Both scientific uncertainty and uncertainty related to the implementation of

a management approach must be explicitly considered and the

management decisions taken must be tempered when necessary to give

effect to the PA (Precautionary Approach). Uncertainty should be

incorporated in the calculation of stock status and biological reference

points. It is desirable that scientific uncertainty be quantified to the extent

possible and used to assess the probability of achieving a target or of a

stock falling to a certain level under a specific management approach.

The appropriate risk to consider when using this framework is the

probability of and the severity of the impact from management actions on

stock productivity. In the framework, the management of this risk is

expressed by the identification and position of reference points, the

changing severity of management actions that are chosen as stock status

changes and the tolerance for stock declines.

To illustrate, in the Healthy zone, where economic considerations may

prevail, stock reductions resulting from management actions with a low

probability of the stock falling to the Critical zone are tolerated because of

their reduced impact on the integrity of the stock. In the Critical zone,

conservation concerns are paramount and there is no tolerance for

preventable declines. Decision rules developed for a fishery should reflect

these general principles.

Management decisions should be explicit about the risk of decline

associated with a management action by deciding on a risk tolerance for a

particular management decision (Annex 2b contains a draft table of risk

tolerance designations). As an illustration, if a stock’s abundance is in the

Cautious zone, near the Critical zone, it may be decided that there is a low

tolerance for a risk of the abundance declining from its current level.

According to the table, a low tolerance for risk is where the risk of a stock’s

decline from its current level is estimated to be between 5% and 25%.

Management actions would then aim to be consistent with this level of risk

tolerance.

Defining growth criteria

When a stock is in the critical zone, management actions must promote

stock growth and removals by all human sources must be kept to the

lowest possible level. However, the development of harvest decision rules

should also include defining growth criteria for the stock when it is in the

Cautious zone. These criteria are recommended as an element of a fully

adapted stock-specific decision framework. They are a primary tool for the

establishment, with industry input, of an agreed growth trajectory for a

stock toward recovery or other targets that are to be achieved within a

specified period and with a high probability.

Optional Elements of the Framework

Stock trajectory

When the stock is in the Cautious or Healthy zone, management actions

could be differentially considered on the basis of both stock status (e.g.

abundance) and trajectory or rate of change in status, within the bounds of

the removal rate strategy appropriate for the status zone. For example,

management actions might appropriately vary if a stock is in the Cautious

zone but clearly improving in status (e.g. growth in abundance), as

opposed to declining sharply (e.g. decrease in abundance) through the

same status zone. Flexibility in management measures is limited in the

critical zone given that when the stock has reached this zone, priority must

be to keep all sources of mortality at the lowest possible level to get the

stock out of the critical zone within a reasonable timeframe, according to

the rebuilding plan. Table 1 provides criteria for developing management

actions in the Cautious and Healthy zones, based on trajectory of the stock.

Considerations for the Application of the Decision
Framework

Tailoring the generalized three-zoned decision framework for an individual

stock and applying it involves a number of steps, as outlined in this paper,

from the determination by science of reference points and stock status in

relation to these points, to the development by fisheries management, in

collaboration with fishery interests, of a harvest rate strategy including pre-

agreed decision rules for each zone of the framework.

For stocks that are currently not in a healthy situation, the identification of

reference points and pre-agreed decision rules will contribute to the

identification of conditions that correspond to a healthy situation and the

necessary measures to reach such conditions. For stocks presently in a

healthy situation, reference points and decision rules will contribute to the

identification of conditions to avoid for a given stock or fishery and will

guide decisions made in advance about the relevant measures necessary to

maintain the stock in a good situation, or the necessary adjustments that

will be required if the condition of the stock changes.

The scientific information available may vary substantially from one stock

to another. Accordingly, different approaches must be used for calculating

LRPs and defining harvest rules that take into account the information

currently available for a given stock. Annex 1b contains reference points

and harvest decision rules that may be considered as the best available

guidance to assess the stock in relation to sustainability and to guide

conservation, in the absence of existing stock or fishery specific

precautionary reference points and harvest decision rules.

The best metric available to identify the conditions where serious harm

could occur should always be chosen. For example, the metric used could

be based on spawning biomass or on a particular sex ratio for a given

species that may increase the risk of impaired productivity. Similarly, a set

of indices, concerning various aspects of a stock or fishery, could inform

about risks to productivity.

In general, as long as a time series as possible should be used in

establishing reference points for a stock. Many stocks will show substantial

variation in productivity over a long time series, and this variation should

be taken into account when setting the reference points.  Scientifically

sound ways have been established for dealing with the special cases when

this variation appears to be structured as periods of consistently high or

low productivity. These cases need to be evaluated individually, but as a

general rule the only circumstances when reference points should be

estimated using only information from a period of low productivity is when

there is no expectation that the conditions consistent with higher

productivity will ever recur naturally or be achievable through

management.

Whenever appropriate, management decisions and actions will take into

account socio-economic factors as well as biological. When a stock is in the

Healthy zone, socio-economic considerations may prevail; in the Cautious

zone, socio-economic and biological factors will be balanced to reflect the

stock trajectory and location in the zone; and in the Critical zone, biological

considerations will prevail.

Producing a workable decision framework for a fishery will require the

participation of fishery interests in all aspects of the process to develop the

framework.

The various components of the framework for a fishery (i.e. the reference

points, removal references and decision rules) should be explicit enough to

allow assessment or evaluation of the performance of the framework. Such

an assessment or evaluation should be considered on a regular basis and it

would normally take place after there is sufficient experience with the

framework to conduct a proper evaluation of its performance (a period of 6

-10 years might provide enough time to gain appropriate experience with

the framework).  However, the availability of any new information that

could have a significant impact on the application of the framework could

justify an earlier evaluation of the framework and adjustments to it, if

necessary.

Finally, the framework for a fishery and its components, as described in this

document, should be considered as risk assessment tools that need to be

reviewed periodically and that may be refined over time.

Stocks in the Critical Zone, Rebuilding Plans and
Management Strategies

In the critical zone, management actions must promote stock growth and

removals from all sources must be kept to the lowest possible level until the

stock has cleared this zone. There should be no tolerance for preventable

decline. When a stock has reached the critical zone, a rebuilding plan must

be in place with the aim of having a high probability of the stock growing

out of the Critical zone within a reasonable timeframe. (This is referenced in

Table 1). This plan must be associated with an appropriate monitoring and

assessment of the condition of the stock to confirm the success of

rebuilding. The plan must also include additional restrictions on catches,

and a provision that application of the measures is mandatory if the

evaluation fails to find clear evidence that rebuilding is occurring.

The development of a rebuilding plan should be initiated enough in

advance to ensure the plan is ready to come into effect at the boundary of

the Critical and Cautious zones if a stock has declined and reached the LRP

(Limit Reference Point). Developing a rebuilding plan may take

considerable time and this should be taken into account in deciding when

to initiate the process. In some cases, a plan could be initiated when the

stock declined past the mid-point of the Cautious zone. If a stock is already

in the critical zone, a rebuilding plan must be developed and implemented

on a priority basis.

When a harvested stock is in the critical zone below the LRP (Limit

Reference Point), long-term sustainable fishery benefits can only be

realized by emphasizing considerable restraint through the stock recovery

phase. Stocks with very low abundance generally have poor productivity,

and therefore, rebuilding is even more challenging. In these circumstances,

concerted action is required to ensure stock recovery occurs. While some

flexibility may be found in the pace established to reach recovery

objectives, it is crucial that rebuilding strategies and rebuilding objectives

are identified that are supportive of the PA (Precautionary Approach). In

many cases, rebuilding of a stock to more sustainable levels has to be seen

in terms of a long time horizon.

Participation of Fishery Interests

To be successful, the utilization of this decision making framework

generally and its application to the specific fisheries needs to be done in

concert with the fishing participants, to which it is applied, and with

engagement of others with an interest, including Provinces, Territories,

Aboriginal people, wildlife management boards (as authorized under a land

claims agreement), processors and others. If effectively implemented in

this way, this approach will facilitate the stable and predictable business

environment in the fishery that participants seek, while at the same time

contributing to sustainability. In fact, decision rules we are seeking to

establish are only likely to hold if they are developed in concert with its

participants. This approach will also provide a stable framework for the

adoption of an “ocean to plate” approach to fisheries management

supportive of long-term planning and engagement. Finally, involving

fishing participants as partners and involving others through engagement

facilitates co-management interactions and shared stewardship.

Scope of Application

Among other things, the Policy is guided by the principle that the fishery is

a common property resource to be managed for the benefit of all

Canadians, consistent with conservation objectives, the constitutional

protection afforded Aboriginal and treaty rights, and the relative

contributions that various uses of the resource make to Canadian society,

including socio-economic benefits to communities.

Annex 1a

The metrics that can be used in relation to the
Precautionary framework

In the context of fisheries management, the limit reference point is the

stock level below which productivity is sufficiently impaired to cause serious

harm. The PA (Precautionary Approach) framework would normally be

described using units that relate directly to stock productivity. For stocks

with age-structured analytical assessments, the most direct measurement

of stock productivity is usually spawning biomass or egg production.

However, it is not always appropriate or possible to have as direct an index

of productivity and hence of serious harm. There are many situations

where spawning biomass is not estimated for a stock and the resource is

managed on the basis of other indicators of stock condition such as catch

rate indices and size/age profiles in the catch. Where necessary, other

metrics can and should be considered for use in defining serious harm and

guiding decision-making in relation to stock condition.

The approach of using a suitable proxy for Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB)

has originally been mentioned in the science framework released in 2006.

However, the use of the concept of “proxies” sometimes creates confusion

and somehow the false perception that SSB is the only right indicator to

identify the productive capacity of a stock, any alternate indicator being a

second best. The estimate of the reproductive/replacement potential must

always be based on the best information available and the approach

retained must be the most appropriate for the stock of concern and data

available.

There are two challenges associated with the choice of the best metric to

be used. The first is to consider what index best represents the potential

productivity of the stock. The second is to consider what conditions,

described using this index, would constitute serious harm to productive

potential (or ability to recover from the perturbation, if the concept of

“productivity” did not apply for some reason) and to then define the

decision-making framework in relation to those conditions. For example, in

a case where the LRP (Limit Reference Point) cannot be derived from the

history of the status of a stock (often because of the proper data were not

collected), the state from which a secure recovery has been demonstrated

under similar conditions might be the best scientific basis for estimating a

limit reference point.

In these cases, there may be added uncertainty about the actual position of

the LRP (Limit Reference Point). This uncertainty should be considered

(among other factors) when locating the USR (Upper Stock Reference

Point). The greater the uncertainty about the degree to which the LRP

(Limit Reference Point) actually reflects a condition associated with serious

harm, the further away the USP should be set from the LRP (Limit

Reference Point).

Annex 1b

Guidance to Identify Reference Points and Harvest
Rules

The preferred approach is always to have reference points and harvest

rules based on the best information available on stock biology and fishery

characteristics while taking into account the limitations of the available

data. However, in some cases there may be insufficient information on

which to base choices of stock-specific precautionary reference points and

harvest rules. The following reference points are emerging from review and

meta-analyses of experience with a wide variety of fish stocks. They are in

line with practices and standards used internationally, such as New Zealand

and USA, and consistent with the language found in various international

agreements. They are indicative of how the range of each stock status zone

should be characterized and, generally, where an LRP (Limit Reference

Point) and USR (Upper Stock Reference Point) should be situated along the

spectrum of a stock’s potential status. In cases where insufficient stock-

specific information is available, these reference points may be considered

as the best available guidance for management and for assessing the stock

in relation to sustainability. Actual reference points for a stock may use

other metrics and be set lower or higher than these references but should

be demonstrably appropriate for the stock and be consistent with the

intent of the PA (Precautionary Approach). For example, the LRP (Limit

Reference Point) must be consistent with a point below which serious harm

is occurring to the stock.  Stocks that are not managed on the basis of

biomass and/or harvest rate controls should adapt the concepts in the

reference points and harvest rules below to their particular circumstance,

while respecting the basic tenants of the PA (Precautionary Approach) as

set out in the general framework.

Stock Status

In critical zone.

The stock is considered to be in “the critical zone” if the mature biomass, or

its index, is less than or equal to 40% of B

. In other words:  Biomass ≤

MSY

40% B

MSY.

In cautious zone.

The stock is considered to be in the “cautious zone” if the biomass, or its

index, is higher than 40% of B

MSY

 but lower than 80% of B

MSY

. In other

words:  40% B

MSY

 < Biomass < 80% B

MSY.

Healthy.

The stock is considered to be “healthy” if the biomass, or its index, is higher

than 80% of B

MSY

. In other words:  Biomass ≥ 80% B

MSY.

Fishery Status

Harvest at or below removal reference. The harvest on this stock is

considered to be at or below the removal reference if the harvest rate, or

the fishing mortality (F), is lower than the provisional harvest rule given
below. In other words: F≤ provisional harvest rule.

Harvest exceeds removal reference. The harvest on this stock is

considered to be above the removal reference if the harvest rate, or the

fishing mortality (F), is higher than the provisional harvest rule given below.

In other words: F > provisional harvest rule.

Provisional Harvest Rule In absence of a pre-agreed harvest rule

developed in the context of the precautionary approach, a provisional

removal reference or fishing mortality (say F ) could be used to guide

p

management and to assess harvest in relation to sustainability. The

provisional harvest rule is as follows:

When the stock is in the “Healthy Zone” : F  < F

p

MSY

When the stock is in the “Cautious Zone” : F  < F

p

MSY

 x ( (Biomass – 40% B

fisheries and oceans resources, including the Fisheries Act, the
Oceans Act, and the Species at Risk Act.

Canada Privy Council Office, 2003. A Framework for the
Application of Precaution in Science-based Decision-Making
about Risk

For the purposes of applying the PA (Precautionary Approach) to
decisions regarding the management of Pacific salmon stocks,
Canada's Policy for Conservation of Wild Pacific Salmon applies.

For example, taking into account the importance of a prey species
when determining appropriate abundance targets.

Long term resource objectives can help to guide decisions and
the design of harvest decision rules as well as serve as the basis
for future reviews of decision-making, harvest rule and fishery
performance. Guidelines will be developed for identifying long
term resource and fishery objectives.

For the purposes of this paper uncertainty is defined as
incomplete knowledge about the state of nature and risk is
defined as the probability of an outcome multiplied by the level of
impact of the outcome.  In the framework, the probability
component of risk is managed by establishing increasingly
stringent management actions and lower tolerances for
preventable decline as the stock moves from the Healthy zone,
through the Cautious zone towards the Critical zone. The impact
component is managed through the use of reference points,
which are discussed in the paper.

In this framework, scientific uncertainty about stock status and/or
stock trajectory must be explicitly considered when establishing
decision rules and management actions. Where due to
uncertainty, two or more status/trajectory combinations could be
considered on the basis of the scientific advice provided,
management actions from the more precautionary combinations
should be followed.

“Stable” may be interpreted as ‘no consistent trend’ to
accommodate an appropriate degree of variability while in the
Cautious and Healthy Zones only.

A reasonable timeframe would normally represent the time for a
cohort to recruit to the spawning biomass and then contribute to
rebuilding the productive capacity of the stock. This period will
vary among species. For many species, it will correspond to a
period of 1.5 – 2 generations but it could be longer for long-lived
species.
