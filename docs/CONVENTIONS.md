# DFO Salmon Ontology â€” Conventions Guide

This document orients new contributors to the modeling conventions used in the **DFO Salmon Ontology**. It explains how to create and refine ontology terms, how to model data in a way that aligns with our goals, and how to prepare new concepts for integration.

The conventions here are **practical starting points**, not immutable rules. As our community gains experience, we expect to refine and evolve them.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Cheatsheet

**For experienced contributors who need a quick reference:**

### Essential Elements (Every Term Needs)

- **Label**: `rdfs:label "Human Name"@en`
- **Definition**: `rdfs:comment "1â€“2 sentence definition."@en`
- **Source**: `rdfs:isDefinedBy <https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon>`

### Naming Conventions

- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `EscapementMeasurement`)
- **Properties**: lowerCamelCase (e.g., `aboutStock`, `usesMethod`)
- **SKOS Concepts**: PascalCase (e.g., `SonarCounting`)

### Core Patterns

- **Measurements**: Must link to stock, event, and method
- **Hierarchy**: SMU â–¶ CU â–¶ Population with `hasMember` relationships (use correct OWL 2 transitivity syntax)
- **Units**: Store QUDT IRIs as literals in `â€¦UnitIRI` properties
- **Darwin Core**: Use as top-level classes for interoperability
- **Hybrid Approach**: SKOS for methods, OWL for events with metadata
- **Manual Classification**: Estimate types are manually assigned based on Hyatt 1997 criteria
- **OBO Relations Ontology for Relations**: Check the [Relations Ontology](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/ro.html) first before defining new relations; use subproperties when extending

### Quality Checklist

- [ ] Can answer a competency question?
- [ ] Follows established design patterns?
- [ ] All required annotations present?
- [ ] Integrates with existing hierarchy?
- [ ] Tested with sample data?
- [ ] Schema only (no instance data in ontology file)?

## 1. Fundamentals

### 1.1 What is Knowledge Modeling?

Knowledge modeling (also called ontology engineering) is the practice of creating formal representations of knowledge that both humans and computers can understand. Think of it as creating a shared vocabulary and set of rules that describe how concepts in a domain relate to each other.

**Why do we need conventions?** Without consistent conventions, different people might model the same concept in different ways, leading to confusion and data that can't be easily combined or queried. Conventions ensure that:

- Everyone uses the same terms for the same concepts
- Data can be automatically validated and processed
- Different systems can exchange information seamlessly
- Future users can understand and extend the work

### 1.2 Ontology vs Knowledge Graph vs Graph Database

Understanding these distinctions is crucial for proper data management and system design.

**Ontology (Schema)**

- **What it is**: A formal specification of concepts, relationships, and rules in a domain
- **Contains**: Classes, properties, SKOS vocabularies, axioms, constraints
- **Purpose**: Defines the "vocabulary" and "grammar" for describing data
- **Example**: `EscapementSurveyEvent` class, `usesEnumerationMethod` property, `SnorkelSurvey` SKOS concept
- **File**: `dfo-salmon.ttl` (schema only, no instance data)

**Knowledge Graph (Data)**

- **What it is**: A collection of interconnected data instances following an ontology schema
- **Contains**: Specific instances, facts, measurements, events
- **Purpose**: Stores actual data using the ontology's vocabulary
- **Example**: `SkeenaSnorkel2022_001` survey event with specific measurements
- **File**: Separate data files (e.g., `survey-data-2022.ttl`)

**Graph Database (Storage)**

- **What it is**: A database system optimized for storing and querying graph-structured data
- **Contains**: Both schema and data, optimized for traversal and querying
- **Purpose**: Efficient storage and retrieval of graph data
- **Example**: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, Apache Jena TDB
- **File**: Database files, not human-readable

**Why This Matters for DFO Salmon Ontology:**

1. **Schema vs Data Separation**: Keep the ontology file clean and focused on definitions
2. **Versioning**: Ontology changes independently of data updates
3. **Reusability**: Same schema can be used for multiple datasets
4. **Maintenance**: Easier to manage and validate schema separately
5. **Interoperability**: Other systems can import just the schema

### 1.3 Why This Ontology?

The **DFO Salmon Ontology** provides a domain-fit semantic layer for Pacific salmon data. It is designed to make datasets from **stock assessment, genetics, and management** interoperable and support **integration** across regional, national, and international systems.

> **ðŸ“‹ Complete Purpose & Objectives**: See the [DFO Salmon Ontology: Product Requirements Document](PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md) for the complete overview of the ontology's purpose, objectives, and target users.

We take inspiration from:

- **Darwin Core (DwC) & the DwC Conceptual Model (DwC-CM)**
- **NCEAS Salmon Ontology (SALMON.ttl)**
- **Standard vocabularies** like QUDT (units), ENVO (environments), and GBIF Backbone (taxa)

### 1.4 Modeling Approach

- We model **primarily in OWL** (Web Ontology Language).
- We **also allow SKOS** for lightweight vocabularies (lists of methods, categories, codes).
- All terms must be represented in **Turtle (.ttl)** format.
- We emphasize **simplicity first**: one ontology file (`dfo-salmon.ttl`) is the starting point.
  - Later, we may modularize into separate files for stock, genetics, governance, etc.

**OBO Foundry Alignment:**

- Follow OBO Foundry principles for open, interoperable ontologies
- Use ROBOT for ontology development workflows
- Maintain logical well-formedness and scientific accuracy
- Ensure non-overlapping and strictly-scoped content
- Use standard OBO annotation properties and relations
- Follow OBO naming conventions and best practices

## 2. Getting Started

### 2.1 Essential Concepts

**What are classes?** Classes represent categories or types of things in your domain. For example, "Stock", "SurveyEvent", and "GeneticSample" are all classes. They're like the nouns in your vocabulary.

**What are properties?** Properties describe relationships between things or attributes of things. For example, "aboutStock" describes which stock a measurement is about, and "usesMethod" describes which method was used.

**What are instances?** Instances are specific examples of classes. For example, "SkeenaSockeye" is an instance of the "Stock" class.

### 2.2 Schema vs Data Separation

**Critical Rule: Keep the Ontology File Clean**

The `dfo-salmon.ttl` file must contain **schema elements only** - no instance data. This separation is essential for maintainability, versioning, and interoperability.

**What Goes in the Ontology File (`dfo-salmon.ttl`):**

- **OWL Classes**: `EscapementSurveyEvent`, `Stock`, `Measurement`
- **OWL Properties**: `usesEnumerationMethod`, `aboutStock`, `hasCountValue`
- **SKOS Concepts**: `SnorkelSurvey`, `Type2`, `VISITS`
- **Axioms and Rules**: Class restrictions, equivalence axioms, SHACL shapes
- **Metadata**: Labels, definitions, sources, examples

**What Does NOT Go in the Ontology File:**

- **Instance Data**: Specific survey events, stock measurements, count values
- **Temporal Data**: Data from specific years, seasons, or time periods
- **Location-Specific Data**: Data tied to specific rivers, regions, or sites
- **Raw Measurements**: Actual count values, efficiency rates, coverage percentages

**Where to Store Instance Data:**

- **Separate RDF files**: `survey-data-2022.ttl`, `stock-data-2023.ttl`
- **Graph databases**: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, Apache Jena TDB
- **Data management systems**: Custom applications with RDF storage

**Example of Proper Separation:**

```turtle
# IN dfo-salmon.ttl (Schema Only)
:EscapementSurveyEvent a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Escapement Survey Event"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "A specific survey event with measured parameters"@en ;
    rdfs:subClassOf dwc:Event .

:SnorkelSurvey a skos:Concept ;
    skos:prefLabel "Visual Snorkel Count"@en ;
    skos:definition "Two or more trained snorkelers conduct standardized passes"@en .

# IN survey-data-2022.ttl (Instance Data Only)
:SkeenaSnorkel2022_001 a :EscapementSurveyEvent ;
    dfo:usesEnumerationMethod :SnorkelSurvey ;
    dfo:measuredVisits 6 ;
    dfo:measuredReachCoverage 0.85 ;
    dwc:eventDate "2022-08-15"^^xsd:date .
```

**Benefits of This Separation:**

- **Stable Schema**: Ontology changes independently of data updates
- **Reusable**: Same schema can be used for multiple datasets
- **Maintainable**: Easier to validate and update schema separately
- **Interoperable**: Other systems can import just the schema
- **Versionable**: Schema and data can have different versioning cycles

**SHACL Validation:**

- **Schema Validation**: SHACL shapes in the ontology file validate data structure
- **Data Validation**: Apply SHACL shapes to instance data files
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures data conforms to schema requirements

### 2.3 Core Conventions

#### 2.3.1 Classes

**Required elements for every class:**

- **Type declaration:** `a owl:Class` - This tells the system this is a class
- **Label:** `rdfs:label "Human Name"@en` - A human-readable name in English
- **Definition:** `rdfs:comment "1â€“2 sentence definition."@en` - A clear explanation of what this class represents
- **Source attribution:** `rdfs:isDefinedBy <https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon>` - Links back to our ontology

**Why these are required:** Labels help humans understand what you mean, definitions prevent confusion about scope, and source attribution ensures proper credit and traceability.

**Example:**

```turtle
:GeneticSample a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Genetic Sample"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "Tissue or material used in genetic stock identification analyses."@en ;
    rdfs:isDefinedBy <https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon> ;
    dcterms:source "DFO Molecular Genetics Lab glossary 2024" ;
    oboInOwl:hasExactSynonym "DNA sample"@en .
```

#### 2.3.2 Object Properties

**What are object properties?** Object properties link instances of one class to instances of another class. For example, "aboutStock" links a measurement to a stock.

**Required elements for every object property:**

- **Type declaration:** `a owl:ObjectProperty`
- **Label:** `rdfs:label "Human Name"@en`
- **Definition:** `rdfs:comment "1â€“2 sentence definition."@en`
- **Source attribution:** `rdfs:isDefinedBy <https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon>`

**Optional but recommended:**

- **Domain:** `rdfs:domain :ClassName` - What type of thing this property describes
- **Range:** `rdfs:range :ClassName` - What type of thing this property points to
- **Source:** `dcterms:source "Reference to where this came from"`
- **Example:** `dcterms:description "Example usage"`

**OBO annotation properties:**

- **Definition:** `oboInOwl:hasDefinition` - Formal definition
- **Exact synonym:** `oboInOwl:hasExactSynonym` - Alternative names with same meaning
- **Related synonym:** `oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym` - Related but not identical terms
- **Broad synonym:** `oboInOwl:hasBroadSynonym` - More general terms
- **Narrow synonym:** `oboInOwl:hasNarrowSynonym` - More specific terms
- **Database cross-reference:** `oboInOwl:hasDbXref` - Links to external databases

**Example:**

```turtle
:aboutStock a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:label "about stock"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "Links a measurement or observation to the specific stock it describes."@en ;
    rdfs:domain :Measurement ;
    rdfs:range :Stock ;
    rdfs:isDefinedBy <https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon> ;
    dcterms:source "DFO stock assessment protocols 2024" .
```

#### 2.3.3 Datatype Properties

**What are datatype properties?** Datatype properties link instances to literal values (text, numbers, dates). For example, "measurementValue" links a measurement to its numeric value.

**Required elements for every datatype property:**

- **Type declaration:** `a owl:DatatypeProperty`
- **Label:** `rdfs:label "Human Name"@en`
- **Definition:** `rdfs:comment "1â€“2 sentence definition."@en`
- **Source attribution:** `rdfs:isDefinedBy <https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon>`

**Optional but recommended:**

- **Domain:** `rdfs:domain :ClassName`
- **Range:** `rdfs:range xsd:datatype` (e.g., `xsd:string`, `xsd:integer`, `xsd:date`)
- **Source:** `dcterms:source "Reference to where this came from"`

**Example:**

```turtle
:measurementValue a owl:DatatypeProperty ;
    rdfs:label "measurement value"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "The numeric value of a measurement."@en ;
    rdfs:domain :Measurement ;
    rdfs:range xsd:decimal ;
    rdfs:isDefinedBy <https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon> .
```

#### 2.3.4 SKOS Concepts

**What are SKOS concepts?** SKOS concepts are for controlled vocabularies - lists of standardized terms like methods, categories, or codes. Use SKOS when you need a picklist rather than a complex class hierarchy.

**Terminology vs Ontology:**

- **Terminology**: A collection of terms with definitions and synonyms (like a dictionary)
- **Ontology**: A formal classification with logical relationships between terms (like a structured knowledge base)
- **Our approach**: We use OWL for formal relationships and SKOS for simple controlled vocabularies

**Required elements for every SKOS concept:**

- **Type declaration:** `a skos:Concept`
- **Label:** `skos:prefLabel "Human Name"@en`
- **Definition:** `skos:definition "1â€“2 sentence definition."@en`
- **Source attribution:** `rdfs:isDefinedBy <https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon>`

**Note on ROBOT Validation:** ROBOT reports missing `rdfs:label` for SKOS concepts that have `skos:prefLabel`. This is a ROBOT limitation - per W3C SKOS specification, `skos:prefLabel` is a subproperty of `rdfs:label`, so these concepts ARE properly labeled. Do not add redundant `rdfs:label` properties to satisfy ROBOT.

**Example:**

```turtle
:SonarCounting a skos:Concept ;
    skos:prefLabel "Sonar Counting"@en ;
    skos:definition "Method of counting fish using sonar technology."@en ;
    rdfs:isDefinedBy <https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon> ;
    skos:broader :CountingMethod .
```

#### 2.3.5 Provenance and Citation Conventions

#### 2.3.5.1 Use of `dcterms:source`, `dcterms:bibliographicCitation`, and `rdfs:seeAlso`

To ensure consistent provenance documentation and FAIR compliance, follow these conventions when citing the source of a definition, dataset, or external standard:

| Property                            | Purpose                                                               | Expected Value Type | Example Use                                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`dcterms:source`**                | Persistent identifier (DOI/Handle/w3id/ARK) for the source resource.  | IRI                 | `<https://doi.org/10.1234/dfostock.2023>`                                |
| **`dcterms:bibliographicCitation`** | Human-readable citation text for the source.                          | Literal (string)    | `"DFO (2023). Escapement Survey Manual, Pacific Region."@en`             |
| **`rdfs:seeAlso`**                  | Optional landing page or download URL for browsers and accessibility. | IRI                 | `<https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/escapement-survey-manual-2023>` |

**Guideline:**  
Use `dcterms:source` for the _persistent identifier_ (prefer DOI/Handle/w3id/ARK), `dcterms:bibliographicCitation` for the _human-readable citation text_, and optionally `rdfs:seeAlso` for _landing pages or download URLs_.

---

#### 2.3.5.2 Example â€” Class Definition with Proper Citation

```turtle
:EscapementSurveyEvent a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Escapement Survey Event"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "A survey event conducted to measure salmon escapement."@en ;
    rdfs:subClassOf dwc:Event ;
    rdfs:isDefinedBy <https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon> ;

    # Non-literal source (preferred: DOI or other persistent IRI)
    dcterms:source <https://doi.org/10.1234/dfostock.2023> ;

    # Human-readable citation text
    dcterms:bibliographicCitation
        "DFO (2023). Escapement Survey Manual, Pacific Region. Fisheries and Oceans Canada."@en ;

    # Optional: landing page or download URL
    rdfs:seeAlso <https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/escapement-survey-manual-2023> .
```

**Explanation:**

- `dcterms:source` provides a _persistent identifier_ (DOI) that machines can resolve.
- `dcterms:bibliographicCitation` provides a _human-readable citation_ following standard bibliographic format.
- `rdfs:seeAlso` provides a _landing page URL_ for easy access and browser navigation.

---

#### 2.3.5.3 Example â€” Dataset or External Resource Reference

```turtle
:BaselineGeneticDataset a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Baseline Genetic Dataset"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "A curated collection of reference genotypes used in genetic stock identification analyses."@en ;
    rdfs:isDefinedBy <https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon> ;

    # Persistent identifier for the dataset
    dcterms:source <https://doi.org/10.1234/dfo-baseline-genotype-2024> ;

    # Human-readable citation
    dcterms:bibliographicCitation
        "DFO Molecular Genetics Laboratory (2024). Baseline Genotype Reference Collection. Fisheries and Oceans Canada."@en ;

    # Optional: data portal landing page
    rdfs:seeAlso <https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/dfo-baseline-genotype-reference-collection> .
```

---

#### 2.3.5.4 Key Points

- âœ… Use **IRI** for `dcterms:source` â€” prefer DOI/Handle/w3id/ARK for persistence
- âœ… Use **`dcterms:bibliographicCitation`** for human-readable citation text (not `dcterms:source`)
- âœ… Use **`rdfs:seeAlso`** optionally for landing pages or download URLs
- âœ… This pattern aligns with DCMI and W3C best practices for provenance and citation

### 2.3.6 Ontology Import Strategy

**Three Approaches: Import vs MIREOT vs Prefix**

Understanding when to use each approach is critical for maintaining a lightweight, performant, and interoperable ontology.

#### 2.3.6.1 Full owl:imports (NOT used in DFO Salmon Ontology)

**Use ONLY when:**

- Using >20 terms from the ontology AND
- Need reasoning over imported axioms AND
- Ontology is small (<100 terms total)

**Risks:**

- Imports entire ontology (100s-1000s of terms)
- Slow loading and reasoning
- Potential conflicts with other imports
- Difficult to track which terms are actually used

**DFO Salmon Decision:** No full imports for MVP

#### 2.3.6.2 MIREOT (Minimum Information to Reference an External Ontology Term)

**Use when:**

- Need 3-20 specific terms with labels/definitions
- Want documentation in your ontology
- Don't need reasoning over the full imported ontology

**Method:**

1. Copy the term IRI (e.g., `bfo:0000015`)
2. Add minimal metadata: `rdfs:label`, `oboInOwl:hasDefinition` (or `rdfs:comment`)
3. Add `rdfs:isDefinedBy` pointing to source ontology
4. Use the term as if it were native

**Benefits:**

- Lightweight (only terms you need)
- No import bloat
- Clear documentation
- Tools like ProtÃ©gÃ© recognize the terms
- Maintains semantic alignment with source

**Example - BFO MIREOT:**

```turtle
# Import specific BFO term via MIREOT
bfo:0000015 a owl:Class ;
  rdfs:label "process"@en ;
  oboInOwl:hasDefinition "An occurrent that has temporal parts."@en ;
  rdfs:isDefinedBy <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo.owl> .

# Now use it in your ontology
dfo:StatusAssessment rdfs:subClassOf bfo:0000015 .  # process
```

**DFO Salmon MIREOT Terms:**

- **BFO** (3 terms): process, material entity, generically dependent continuant
- **IAO** (4 terms): measurement datum, value specification, information content entity, directive information entity
- **DQV** (5 terms): Dimension, QualityAnnotation, inDimension, Metric, Category

**Why BFO for FSAR Tracer:**

- Clarifies entity types: processes (events, methods) vs material entities (organisms, samples) vs information entities (datasets, documents)
- Enables OBO Foundry alignment: Most OBO ontologies (including IAO) are grounded in BFO
- Improves reasoning: Proper BFO grounding enables better logical inference
- Doesn't compete with PROV-O: BFO = what things ARE; PROV-O = how things were DERIVED

#### 2.3.6.3 Prefix Declarations Only

**Use when:**

- Using properties only (not classes)
- Terms are universally known (SKOS, Dublin Core)
- Pure data typing (xsd:)
- Lightweight alignment without local definitions

**Method:**

1. Declare prefix: `@prefix prov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#>`
2. Use terms directly in your ontology
3. No local definitions needed
4. Assumes external ontology is accessible

**Benefits:**

- Minimal overhead
- Clean separation
- Standard practice for well-known vocabularies

**Example - PROV-O Prefix Only:**

```turtle
# Declare prefix (no import, no local definitions)
@prefix prov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#> .

# Use PROV-O properties directly
:BarkleyStatus2025 prov:used :EscapementDataset2025 ;
  prov:wasGeneratedBy :SRBenchmarkMethod ;
  prov:wasAttributedTo :StockAssessmentTeam .
```

**DFO Salmon Prefix-Only:**

- **PROV-O** (~6 properties): wasGeneratedBy, wasDerivedFrom, used, wasAttributedTo, etc.
- **RO** (alignment via rdfs:seeAlso): has_member, member_of
- **SKOS** (extensive): Concept, ConceptScheme, prefLabel, definition, etc.
- **DwC** (extensive): Event, Organism, MeasurementOrFact, etc.

#### 2.3.6.4 Decision Matrix

| Ontology   | Approach    | Terms Used                 | Rationale                              |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **BFO**    | MIREOT      | 3 classes                  | Upper ontology grounding               |
| **IAO**    | MIREOT      | 4 classes                  | Information artifacts (already in use) |
| **DQV**    | MIREOT      | 5 terms                    | Evidence completeness tracking         |
| **PROV-O** | Prefix only | ~6 properties              | Provenance relations                   |
| **RO**     | Prefix only | Alignment via rdfs:seeAlso | Semantic documentation                 |
| **SKOS**   | Prefix only | Extensive                  | Core W3C vocabulary                    |
| **DwC**    | Prefix only | Extensive                  | Biodiversity standard                  |
| **SHACL**  | Prefix only | Validation language        | Not a domain ontology                  |

**Why This Matters:**

- **Performance**: MIREOT = fast loading; full imports = slow
- **Clarity**: Local term definitions aid understanding in ProtÃ©gÃ©
- **Maintenance**: Fewer dependencies = easier updates
- **Interoperability**: Pragmatic balance between standards compliance and usability

**FSAR Tracer Specific Usage:**

BFO Classes (via MIREOT):

- `bfo:0000015` (process) â†’ StatusAssessment, AnalysisMethod, ManagementDecision
- `bfo:0000040` (material entity) â†’ Stock, GeneticSample
- `bfo:0000031` (generically dependent continuant) â†’ ScientificOutput

DQV Classes (via MIREOT):

- `dqv:Dimension` â†’ EvidenceCompletenessDimension, DataCurrencyDimension
- `dqv:QualityAnnotation` â†’ CompleteEvidence, GapsEvidence, MissingCriticalEvidence

PROV-O Properties (prefix-only):

- `prov:used` â†’ StatusAssessment uses Dataset/ReferencePoint
- `prov:wasGeneratedBy` â†’ StatusAssessment generated by AnalysisMethod
- `prov:wasDerivedFrom` â†’ ScientificOutput derived from StatusAssessment
- `prov:wasAttributedTo` â†’ StatusAssessment attributed to Agent

### 2.4 Hybrid Modeling Approach for Automated Classification

**Why a hybrid approach?** For automated classification systems (like Estimate Type assignment), we need both controlled vocabularies (methods) and rich data modeling (events with metadata). This hybrid approach separates concerns while enabling automation.

**Four-Layer Architecture:**

1. **Methods as SKOS Concepts** - Controlled vocabularies for enumeration and estimation methods
2. **Events as OWL Classes** - Survey/estimate events that extend Darwin Core Event
3. **Metadata on Events** - Rich data about how methods were applied in specific surveys
4. **Downgrade Criteria as SKOS** - Standardized criteria for automated type assignment

**Complete Example:**

```turtle
# Layer 1: SKOS Methods (Controlled Vocabularies)
:SnorkelSurvey a skos:Concept ;
    skos:prefLabel "Visual Snorkel Count"@en ;
    skos:definition "Two or more trained snorkelers conduct standardized passes within defined segments"@en ;
    skos:inScheme :EnumerationMethodScheme ;
    skos:broader :VisualSurveyMethod .

:AreaUnderCurve a skos:Concept ;
    skos:prefLabel "Area Under the Curve (AUC)"@en ;
    skos:definition "Integrates serial counts over time using a survey-life parameter"@en ;
    skos:inScheme :EstimateMethodScheme .

# Layer 2: SKOS Downgrade Criteria

    skos:prefLabel "Number of visits"@en ;
    skos:definition "Too few site visits for the claimed precision tier"@en ;
    skos:inScheme :DowngradeCriteriaScheme .

:REACH_COVERAGE a skos:Concept ;

```

**Key Principles:**

- **Methods are vocabulary terms** - Use SKOS for enumeration methods, estimate methods, and downgrade criteria
- **Events carry the data** - OWL classes for survey events with rich metadata properties
- **Metadata on instances** - Observer efficiency, coverage, visibility are properties of specific surveys
- **Automated classification** - Rules engine checks event metadata against method-specific thresholds

### 2.5 Data Validation with SHACL

**Why SHACL?** SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) provides validation rules that can enforce data quality and ensure required fields are present. It separates data validation from classification logic.

**Note:** Estimate types are manually assigned based on Hyatt 1997 criteria. Automated classification is deferred to post-MVP.

**SHACL Shape for Method Validation:**

```turtle
# SHACL Shape for Snorkel Survey Events
:SnorkelSurveyShape a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:targetClass :EscapementSurveyEvent ;
    sh:property [
        sh:path dfo:usesEnumerationMethod ;
        sh:hasValue :SnorkelSurvey ;
        sh:message "Survey must use snorkel enumeration method"
    ] ;
    sh:property [
        sh:path dfo:measuredVisits ;
        sh:datatype xsd:integer ;
        sh:minInclusive 1 ;
        sh:message "Number of visits must be a positive integer"
    ] ;
    sh:property [
        sh:path dfo:measuredReachCoverage ;
        sh:datatype xsd:decimal ;
        sh:minInclusive 0.0 ;
        sh:maxInclusive 1.0 ;
        sh:message "Reach coverage must be between 0.0 and 1.0"
    ] ;
    sh:property [
        sh:path dfo:measuredVisibility ;
        sh:in ( :Excellent :Good :Fair :Poor ) ;
        sh:message "Visibility must be one of: Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor"
    ] .
```

**Implementation Pipeline:**

1. **Data Entry** - Users create survey events with metadata
2. **SHACL Validation** - Ensures required fields are present and valid
3. **Manual Classification** - Estimate types assigned based on Hyatt 1997 criteria
4. **Quality Assessment** - Review data completeness and quality

### 2.6 Naming Conventions

**Classes:** Use PascalCase (e.g., `EscapementMeasurement`, `GeneticSample`)
**Properties:** Use lowerCamelCase (e.g., `aboutStock`, `usesMethod`, `hasMember`)
**SKOS Concepts:** Use PascalCase (e.g., `SonarCounting`, `MicrosatelliteAssay`)
**Instances:** Use PascalCase with descriptive names (e.g., `SkeenaSockeye`, `FraserCoho`)

**Why consistent naming matters:** It makes the ontology easier to read, understand, and maintain. It also helps prevent confusion when multiple people are contributing.

## 3. Design Patterns

### 3.1 Measurement Patterns

**Basic Measurement Pattern:**
Every measurement must have:

- `dwc:measurementType` - What was measured
- `dwc:measurementValue` - The measured value
- `dwc:measurementUnit` - The unit of measurement
- `dfo:aboutStock` - Which stock it describes
- `dfo:observedDuring` - Which event it was collected during
- `dfo:usesMethod` - Which method was used

**Example:**

```turtle
:EscapementCount2022 a dfo:EscapementMeasurement ;
    dwc:measurementType "abundance" ;
    dwc:measurementValue "1250"^^xsd:integer ;
    dwc:measurementUnit "http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/Each" ;
    dfo:aboutStock :SkeenaSockeye ;
    dfo:observedDuring :SkeenaSurvey2022 ;
    dfo:usesMethod :SonarCounting .
```

### 3.2 Hierarchy Patterns

**Management Hierarchy Pattern:**

- Management Units contain Conservation Units
- Conservation Units contain Stocks
- Use transitive `dfo:hasMember` relationships
- Create type-specific subproperties for clarity

**Example:**

```turtle
:BCInteriorMU a dfo:ManagementUnit ;
    dfo:hasMemberCU :FraserCUCoho .

:FraserCUCoho a dfo:ConservationUnit ;
    dfo:hasMemberStock :FraserCohoStock .

# Transitive inference: BCInteriorMU hasMember FraserCohoStock
```

### 3.3 Event Patterns

**Survey Event Pattern:**

- Surveys contain multiple measurement events
- Each measurement event has specific protocols
- Events can be nested (project > survey > measurement)

**Example:**

```turtle
:SalmonSurvey2023 a eco:Survey ;
    dwc:eventDate "2023-05-01/2023-09-30"^^xsd:gYear ;
    dwc:samplingProtocol :DFOEscapementProtocol .

:DailyCount2023_06_15 a dfo:EscapementSurveyEvent ;
    dwc:parentEventID :SalmonSurvey2023 ;
    dwc:eventDate "2023-06-15"^^xsd:date ;
    dwc:samplingProtocol :SonarCountingProtocol .
```

## 4. Darwin Core Integration

**Why integrate with Darwin Core?** Darwin Core provides a widely-adopted standard for biodiversity data that enables interoperability with GBIF, OBIS, and other international biodiversity platforms. By aligning with Darwin Core, your salmon data becomes discoverable and usable by the broader scientific community.

> **ðŸ“‹ Complete Darwin Core Integration**: See the [DFO Salmon Ontology: Product Requirements Document](PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md) for the complete technical approach, including hybrid modeling strategy, core patterns, and Darwin Core integration details.

**Key Darwin Core Classes to Use:**

- `dwc:Event` - Actions, processes, or circumstances occurring at a place and time
- `dwc:Occurrence` - A state of an organism in an event
- `dwc:Organism` - A particular organism or defined group of organisms
- `dwc:MaterialEntity` - Physical entities that can be identified and consist of matter
- `dwc:Identification` - Taxonomic determinations of organisms
- `dwc:Agent` - People, groups, organizations, machines, or software that can act
- `dwc:Media` - Digital media (images, videos, sounds, text)
- `dwc:Protocol` - Methods used during actions

**DFO Extensions:**

```turtle
# DFO-specific classes that extend Darwin Core
dfo:ManagementUnit rdfs:subClassOf dwc:Event ;
    rdfs:label "Management Unit"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "A geographic or administrative unit for salmon management"@en .

dfo:ConservationUnit rdfs:subClassOf dwc:Event ;
    rdfs:label "Conservation Unit"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "A biologically meaningful unit for conservation planning"@en .

dfo:Stock rdfs:subClassOf dwc:Organism ;
    rdfs:label "Stock"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "A population of salmon with distinct characteristics"@en .
```

## 6. Advanced Topics

### 6.1 Competency Questions

**What are competency questions?** These are the specific questions your ontology should be able to answer. They guide design decisions and validate that the ontology serves its intended purpose. Competency questions are essential for ensuring your ontology can actually support the research and data integration needs of the salmon science community.

**Why competency questions matter:**

- **Design guidance**: Help determine what terms and relationships are needed
- **Validation mechanism**: Ensure the ontology can answer the questions it's designed to address
- **Testing framework**: Enable systematic validation of the ontology's utility
- **Community alignment**: Ensure all stakeholders understand the ontology's purpose

> **ðŸ“‹ Complete Competency Questions**: See the [DFO Salmon Ontology: Competency Questions](COMPETENCY_QUESTIONS.md) for the complete, authoritative list of competency questions organized by domain (Stock Assessment, Genetics/GSI, Management & Policy, and Cross-Domain Integration).

#### 6.1.1 Using Competency Questions

**During Design:**

- Write competency questions before creating new terms
- Use them to identify missing relationships or classes
- Ensure each new term contributes to answering at least one question

**During Validation:**

- Convert competency questions to SPARQL queries when possible
- Test queries with sample data to ensure they return meaningful results
- Use them to validate that the ontology serves its intended purpose

**Example SPARQL Query:**

```sparql
# Find all escapement methods used for Sockeye stocks in 2022
PREFIX dfo: <https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon#>
PREFIX dwc: <http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/>

SELECT ?method ?stock ?event WHERE {
  ?measurement dfo:aboutStock ?stock ;
               dfo:usesMethod ?method ;
               dfo:observedDuring ?event .
  ?event dwc:eventDate "2022"^^xsd:gYear .
  ?stock rdfs:label ?stockLabel .
  FILTER(CONTAINS(?stockLabel, "Sockeye"))
}
```

### 6.2 Troubleshooting

**Why troubleshooting matters:** Ontology development involves complex logical relationships that can lead to unexpected errors. Understanding common issues and their solutions helps you develop more effectively and avoid common pitfalls.

#### 6.2.1 Logical Consistency Issues

**Problem: Term appears under owl:Nothing**

- **Cause**: Logical inconsistency (e.g., conflicting restrictions, disjoint classes)
- **Solution**:
  1. Click the ? button next to owl:Nothing to see explanation
  2. Check for disjoint class assertions that conflict
  3. Look for contradictory domain/range restrictions
  4. Remove or modify conflicting axioms

**Problem: Missing inferred relationships**

- **Cause**: Reasoner not run or missing logical axioms
- **Solution**:
  1. Run the reasoner (ELK or HermiT)
  2. Add necessary equivalence axioms
  3. Check that subclass relationships are properly defined

**Problem: Unexpected classification results**

- **Cause**: Incorrect logical definitions or missing restrictions
- **Solution**:
  1. Review equivalence axioms carefully
  2. Check that restrictions use correct quantifiers (some vs. only)
  3. Verify that property chains are properly defined

#### 6.2.2 Content and Design Issues

**Problem: Can't find existing term**

- **Cause**: Search in wrong ontology or using wrong label
- **Solution**:
  1. Use broader search terms
  2. Check synonyms and alternative names
  3. Search in the correct ontology namespace
  4. Use partial string matching

**Problem: Term doesn't integrate with existing hierarchy**

- **Cause**: Missing subclass relationships or incorrect placement
- **Solution**:
  1. Identify the correct parent class
  2. Add appropriate subclass relationships
  3. Check that the term fits the intended hierarchy
  4. Consider if the term should be a different type (class vs. property)

**Problem: Relationships don't work as expected**

- **Cause**: Incorrect domain/range restrictions or missing properties
- **Solution**:
  1. Check that domain/range restrictions are appropriate
  2. Verify that properties are properly typed
  3. Ensure that relationships are defined in the correct direction
  4. Test with sample data

#### 6.2.3 Technical Issues

**Problem: Ontology won't load in ProtÃ©gÃ©**

- **Cause**: Syntax errors, missing imports, or file corruption
- **Solution**:
  1. Check for syntax errors in Turtle/RDF
  2. Verify that all imports are accessible
  3. Try loading a smaller subset of the ontology
  4. Check file encoding and line endings

**Problem: Reasoner runs very slowly**

- **Cause**: Complex logical definitions or large ontology
- **Solution**:
  1. Use a faster reasoner (ELK instead of HermiT)
  2. Simplify complex logical definitions
  3. Consider modularizing the ontology
  4. Remove unnecessary axioms

**Problem: SPARQL queries return no results**

- **Cause**: Incorrect query syntax or missing data
- **Solution**:
  1. Check query syntax carefully
  2. Verify that data exists for the query
  3. Test with simpler queries first
  4. Check that namespaces are properly declared

#### 6.2.4 Known Tool Warnings

**Problem: JFact datatype warning for EstimateType**

- **Warning**: `ERROR uk.ac.manchester.cs.jfact.datatypes.DatatypeFactory - A known datatype for https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon#EstimateType cannot be found; literal will be replaced with rdfs:Literal`
- **Root Cause**: `EstimateType` is correctly modeled as `skos:Concept` (not a datatype). JFact's datatype checking system is confused by SKOS concept usage as object property ranges.
- **Impact**: None - all reasoners (ELK, HermiT, JFact) produce identical results (2183 lines). Ontology is logically consistent.
- **Action**: This warning can be safely ignored.

#### 6.2.5 Getting Help

**When to ask for help:**

- You've tried the troubleshooting steps but the problem persists
- The issue affects multiple terms or relationships
- You're unsure about the correct modeling approach
- The problem seems to be a bug in the tools

**How to ask for help:**

- Provide a clear description of the problem
- Include relevant code snippets or error messages
- Explain what you've already tried
- Specify which tools and versions you're using

**Where to get help:**

- GitHub Issues for the DFO Salmon Ontology
- OBO Foundry community forums
- ProtÃ©gÃ© user mailing lists
- Ontology development workshops and training

### 6.3 Hierarchy and Relationship Conventions

#### 6.3.1 Subclassing

**What is subclassing?** Subclassing represents "is-a" relationships. For example, "Sockeye" is a subclass of "Salmon" because every sockeye is a salmon.

**When to use subclassing:**

- When one class is a more specific type of another
- When all instances of the subclass are also instances of the superclass
- When you want to inherit properties from the parent class

**Example:**

```turtle
:Sockeye rdfs:subClassOf :Salmon ;
    rdfs:label "Sockeye"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "A species of salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka)"@en .
```

#### 6.3.2 Equivalence

**What is equivalence?** Equivalence states that two classes are identical in meaning. Use this when two terms represent exactly the same concept.

**When to use equivalence:**

- When two classes have identical meaning but different names
- When aligning with external vocabularies
- When consolidating duplicate concepts

**Example:**

```turtle
:Escapement rdfs:subClassOf :Measurement ;
    owl:equivalentClass dwc:MeasurementOrFact ;
    rdfs:label "Escapement"@en .
```

#### 6.3.3 Disjointness

**What is disjointness?** Disjointness states that two classes cannot have common instances. Use this when classes are mutually exclusive.

**When to use disjointness:**

- When classes represent mutually exclusive categories
- When you want to prevent logical inconsistencies
- When modeling taxonomic hierarchies

**Example:**

```turtle
:Freshwater rdfs:subClassOf :Environment ;
    owl:disjointWith :Marine .

:Marine rdfs:subClassOf :Environment ;
    owl:disjointWith :Freshwater .
```

### 6.4 Membership and Roll-up Pattern (MU â–¶ CU â–¶ Stock)

**What is the membership pattern?** This pattern represents the hierarchical relationship between Management Units, Conservation Units, and Stocks in salmon management.

**The Pattern:**

- Management Units contain Conservation Units
- Conservation Units contain Stocks
- Use transitive `hasMember` relationships
- Create type-specific subproperties for clarity

**Implementation:**

```turtle
# Define the base membership property
:hasMember a owl:ObjectProperty, owl:TransitiveProperty ;
    rdfs:label "has member"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "A transitive relationship indicating membership in a group"@en .

# Define type-specific subproperties
:hasMemberCU rdfs:subPropertyOf :hasMember ;
    rdfs:label "has member conservation unit"@en ;
    rdfs:domain :ManagementUnit ;
    rdfs:range :ConservationUnit .

:hasMemberStock rdfs:subPropertyOf :hasMember ;
    rdfs:label "has member stock"@en ;
    rdfs:domain :ConservationUnit ;
    rdfs:range :Stock .

# Example usage
:BCInteriorMU a :ManagementUnit ;
    :hasMemberCU :FraserCUCoho .

:FraserCUCoho a :ConservationUnit ;
    :hasMemberStock :FraserCohoStock .

# Transitive inference: BCInteriorMU hasMember FraserCohoStock
```

### 6.5 Measurement and GSI Conventions

#### 6.5.1 Escapement Measurements

**Required elements for every escapement measurement:**

- `dwc:measurementType` - What was measured (e.g., "abundance")
- `dwc:measurementValue` - The measured value
- `dwc:measurementUnit` - The unit of measurement (QUDT IRI)
- `dfo:aboutStock` - Which stock it describes
- `dfo:observedDuring` - Which event it was collected during
- `dfo:usesMethod` - Which method was used

**Example:**

```turtle
:EscapementCount2022 a :EscapementMeasurement ;
    dwc:measurementType "abundance" ;
    dwc:measurementValue "1250"^^xsd:integer ;
    dwc:measurementUnit "http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/Each" ;
    dfo:aboutStock :SkeenaSockeye ;
    dfo:observedDuring :SkeenaSurvey2022 ;
    dfo:usesMethod :SonarCounting .
```

#### 6.5.2 GSI Composition Measurements

**Required elements for every GSI measurement:**

- `dfo:aboutReportingUnit` - Which genetic reporting unit
- `dfo:proportion` - The proportion of the sample
- `dfo:confidence` - Confidence interval or quality measure
- `dfo:analyzedIn` - Which GSI run produced this result
- `dfo:basedOnSamples` - Which samples were analyzed

**Example:**

```turtle
:GSIResult2023_001 a :GSICompositionMeasurement ;
    dfo:aboutReportingUnit :FraserSockeyeRU ;
    dfo:proportion "0.85"^^xsd:decimal ;
    dfo:confidence "0.02"^^xsd:decimal ;
    dfo:analyzedIn :GSIRun2023_001 ;
    dfo:basedOnSamples :SampleSet2023_001 .
```

### 6.6 External Alignments

**Why external alignments matter:** They ensure your ontology can work with other systems and datasets, making your data more discoverable and useful.

**Key external vocabularies:**

- **QUDT**: Units of measurement (http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/)
- **ENVO**: Environmental terms (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_)
- **GBIF Backbone**: Taxonomic names (http://www.gbif.org/species/)
- **Darwin Core**: Biodiversity data standards (http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/)
- **RO (Relations Ontology)**: Standard relations (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_)

**OBO Foundry Relation Reuse Requirements:**

- **Check RO first**: Before defining new relations, check if equivalent relations exist in RO
- **Use RO IRIs**: When equivalent relations exist, use the RO IRI directly or create subproperties
- **Avoid label conflicts**: OBO Foundry review flags non-RO relations with RO-equivalent labels
- **Subproperty alignment**: Create subproperties of RO relations when domain-specific extensions are needed

**Example RO Alignment:**

```turtle
# Instead of defining a new "hasMember" property, align with RO
:hasMember rdfs:subPropertyOf ro:has_part ;
    rdfs:label "has member"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "A transitive relationship indicating membership in a group"@en .

# Or use RO directly when appropriate
:populationOf ro:part_of :stock ;
    rdfs:label "population of"@en .
```

**Implementation:**

- Store external IRIs as literals in `â€¦UnitIRI` properties
- Use `dcterms:source` to reference external vocabularies
- Plan to convert to object properties in future versions
- Check RO for existing relations before defining new ones

**Unit Property Enhancement (Non-breaking):**
For richer unit semantics, consider adding object properties alongside datatype properties:

```turtle
# Current approach: Store QUDT IRIs as literals
:measurementUnitIRI a owl:DatatypeProperty ;
    rdfs:label "measurement unit IRI"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "IRI of the unit used in a measurement"@en ;
    rdfs:domain :Measurement ;
    rdfs:range xsd:anyURI .

# Enhanced approach: Add object property for reasoning
:hasUnit a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:label "has unit"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "Links a measurement to a unit (e.g., QUDT Unit)"@en ;
    rdfs:domain :Measurement ;
    rdfs:range qudt:Unit ;
    rdfs:isDefinedBy <https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon> .

# Example usage with both approaches
:EscapementCount2022 a :EscapementMeasurement ;
    :measurementUnitIRI "http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/Each"^^xsd:anyURI ;
    :hasUnit qudt:Each .
```

**Trade-offs:**

- **Datatype approach**: Pragmatic storage and mapping, but reasoning can't follow strings to unit classes
- **Object property approach**: Enables richer unit semantics and reasoning, but requires unit ontology imports
- **Hybrid approach**: Use both for maximum flexibility and backward compatibility

### 6.7 IRI and Versioning Policy

#### 6.7.1 IRI Structure

**Base IRI:** `https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon#`

**Class IRIs:** `https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon#ClassName`
**Property IRIs:** `https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon#propertyName`
**Instance IRIs:** `https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon#InstanceName`

**Example:**

```turtle
@prefix dfo: <https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon#> .

dfo:EscapementMeasurement a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Escapement Measurement"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "A measurement of salmon escapement"@en .
```

#### 6.7.2 Versioning

**Ontology versioning:**

- Use `owl:versionInfo` for version numbers
- Use `owl:versionIRI` for version-specific IRIs
- Tag releases in GitHub
- Maintain changelog

**Example:**

```turtle
<https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon> a owl:Ontology ;
    owl:versionInfo "1.0.0" ;
    owl:versionIRI <https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon/1.0.0> ;
    rdfs:label "DFO Salmon Ontology"@en .
```

### 6.8 Spreadsheet Templates for New Terms

**Why use templates?** Spreadsheet templates help domain experts contribute terms without needing to learn OWL syntax. They also ensure consistency and completeness.

**Template columns:**

- **Term Name**: The name of the term
- **Type**: Class, ObjectProperty, DatatypeProperty, or SKOS Concept
- **Label**: Human-readable name
- **Definition**: Clear definition
- **Parent**: Parent class or broader concept
- **Source**: Where the definition came from
- **Example**: Usage example
- **Notes**: Additional comments

**Example template row:**
| Term Name | Type | Label | Definition | Parent | Source | Example | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|------------|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| EscapementMeasurement | Class | Escapement Measurement | A measurement of salmon escapement | Measurement | DFO protocols 2024 | Sonar count of 1,250 fish | Must link to stock and method |

### 6.9 Using Darwin Core Conceptual Model

**Why follow Darwin Core?** Darwin Core provides a widely-adopted standard for biodiversity data that enables interoperability with GBIF, OBIS, and other international platforms.

> **ðŸ“‹ Complete Darwin Core Integration**: See the [DFO Salmon Ontology: Product Requirements Document](PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md) for the complete technical approach and Darwin Core integration strategy.

### 6.10 Common Modeling Scenarios

#### 6.10.1 Stock Assessment Scenario

**Scenario:** Modeling a sonar count of sockeye escapement

**Required elements:**

- Event (when and where the count occurred)
- Stock (which stock was counted)
- Method (sonar counting)
- Measurement (the count value and unit)
- Agent (who conducted the count)

**Example:**

```turtle
:SkeenaSurvey2023 a eco:Survey ;
    dwc:eventDate "2023-08-15"^^xsd:date ;
    dwc:samplingProtocol :SonarCountingProtocol ;
    dwc:recordedBy :DFOFieldTeam .

:SkeenaSockeye a dfo:Stock ;
    rdfs:label "Skeena Sockeye"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "Sockeye salmon from the Skeena River watershed"@en .

    dwc:measurementType "abundance" ;
    dwc:measurementValue "1250"^^xsd:integer ;
    dwc:measurementUnit "http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/Each" ;
    dfo:aboutStock :SkeenaSockeye ;
    dfo:observedDuring :SkeenaSurvey2023 ;
    dfo:usesMethod :SonarCounting .
```

#### 6.10.2 GSI Analysis Scenario

**Scenario:** Modeling genetic stock identification results

**Required elements:**

- GSI Run (when and how the analysis was performed)
- Samples (what was analyzed)
- Reporting Units (genetic populations)
- Composition Results (proportions and confidence)

**Example:**

```turtle
:GSIRun2023_001 a dfo:GSIRun ;
    dwc:eventDate "2023-06-15"^^xsd:date ;
    dfo:usedAssay :MicrosatelliteAssay ;
    dfo:usedMarkerPanel :PacificSalmonPanel .

:FraserSockeyeRU a dfo:ReportingUnit ;
    rdfs:label "Fraser Sockeye Reporting Unit"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "Genetic reporting unit for Fraser River sockeye"@en .

:GSIResult2023_001 a dfo:GSICompositionMeasurement ;
    dfo:aboutReportingUnit :FraserSockeyeRU ;
    dfo:proportion "0.85"^^xsd:decimal ;
    dfo:confidence "0.02"^^xsd:decimal ;

### 7.1 Tools and Workflows

**Essential Tools:**

- **ProtÃ©gÃ©**: Visual ontology editor (https://protege.stanford.edu/)
- **WebProtÃ©gÃ©**: Collaborative online editor
- **ROBOT**: Command-line ontology tools (http://robot.obolibrary.org/)
- **OntoGraf**: ProtÃ©gÃ© plugin for visualizing relationships

**OBO-Style Development Workflow:**

1. **Start with competency questions** to guide design
2. **Use ROBOT for quality control**:
   - `robot reason` to check logical consistency
   - `robot validate` to check for common issues
   - `robot template` for consistent term creation
3. **Create terms following core conventions**
4. **Test with sample data** and competency questions
5. **Use ROBOT for release management**:
   - `robot merge` to combine modules
   - `robot annotate` to add metadata
   - `robot convert` for format conversion
6. **Submit for community review**

**ROBOT Commands for DFO Salmon Ontology:**

```bash
# Check logical consistency
robot reason --input dfo-salmon.ttl --reasoner ELK

# Validate ontology
robot validate --input dfo-salmon.ttl

# Convert to other formats
robot convert --input dfo-salmon.ttl --output dfo-salmon.owl

# Add metadata
robot annotate --input dfo-salmon.ttl --ontology-iri "https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon" --version-iri "https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon/1.0.0" --output dfo-salmon-annotated.ttl
