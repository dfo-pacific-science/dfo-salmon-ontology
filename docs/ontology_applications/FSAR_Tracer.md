## User Personas

Persona A — Executive / Regional Director / Assistant Deputy Minister

(Science • Fisheries Management • Habitat • Ecosystem Science • Salmon Enhancement)

Goals: Rapid situational awareness and assurance that the advice is defensible, policy‑aligned, and ready; understand what changed since last cycle, what risks remain, and which decisions (TAC/HCR, access, rebuilding) are impacted.

Pain points: Fragmented evidence across branches; late reconciliation of methods/benchmarks; opaque provenance; last‑minute surprises during approvals; hard to compare year‑over‑year status and triggers; too many PDFs, not enough signal.

Environment: M365/SharePoint/Teams; tight schedules; mobile or second‑screen usage; prefers an executive one‑pager with drill‑downs and clear R/A/G badges.

Success measures: See Readiness in <60s; clear list of changes vs last FSAR; explicit risk/caveat flags (e.g., proxy without justification); downloadable briefing/audit pack.
