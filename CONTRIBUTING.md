# Contributing to GC DFO Salmon Ontology

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the GC DFO Salmon Ontology! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Check whether the term already exists

Before submitting suggestions for new ontology terms, check whether the term already exists, either as a primary term or a synonym. To do this, search the ontology within the [FADS Open Science Documentation Hub](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/data-stewardship-unit/reference_info/data_standards/controlled-vocabulary-thesauri.html) or browse the [ontology file](https://github.com/dfo-pacific-science/dfo-salmon-ontology/blob/main/ontology/dfo-salmon.ttl) directly. If you feel a synonym is missing, or the textual definition of a term needs clarification, please submit a ticket for that.

### 2. Gather as much necessary information as possible

**For new term requests:** Please always provide suggestions for a **name (required)**, **definition (required)**, **definition source (required)**, position in hierarchy, and synonyms, if applicable. The ontology editors can more easily process term requests when all of this information is provided. 

**For updates to relationships:** Provide details of the current relationships, why you think they are wrong or insufficient, and exactly what should be added or removed.

**Please add a label to your ticket:** A label will pre-populate with the chosen template, but you can add additional labels from the labels menu at the bottom of the editing boxes when adding a new issue in GitHub.

#### Other helpful reminders:

1. Write a detailed request: Please be specific in your request and include as many details as necessary, providing background information, and if possible, suggesting a solution. The editors will be better equipped to address your suggestions if you offer details regarding 'what is wrong', 'why', and 'how to fix it'.

2. Provide examples and references: Please always include references for new term requests and, for other term-related requests, include also screenshots, or URLs illustrating the current ontology structure. This will be very helpful to the ontology editors.

3. Tickets with insufficient detail will be marked with a 'More info needed' label to alert the submitter. The ontology editors can process requests more rapidly when all the required information is provided.

### 3. Communicate with the GCDFO Salmon ontology editors

1. The preferred way is to create a ticket using the [DFO Salmon Ontology tracking system](https://github.com/dfo-pacific-science/dfo-salmon-ontology/issues). This allows you to monitor the progress on work on the issue, and participate in the discussion among the GC DFO Salmon ontology team members. Detailed instructions about how to create a free account and use the GitHub repository can be found [here](./docs/SUBMIT_REQUESTS_README.md).

2. Alternatively, contact the DFO Pacific Fishery & Assessment Data Section [Data Stewardship Unit](FADSDataStewardship-GestiondesdonneesSFDA@dfo-mpo.gc.ca) for your requests. Note that these requests may have a longer response time. 

3. You can also explore our [draft terms](./draft/dfo-salmon-draft.ttl) to see what is currently under review.
