ERROR	multiple_definitions	http://www.w3.org/ns/dqv#inDimension	IAO:0000115	Dimensions are meant to systematically organize metrics, quality certificates and quality annotations. The Data Quality Vocabulary defines no specific cardinality constraints for dqv:inDimension, since distinct quality frameworks might have different perspectives over a metric. A metric may therefore be associated to more than one dimension. However, those who define new quality metrics should try to avoid this as much as possible and assign only one dimension to the metrics they define. More than one dimension can be indicated for each quality annotation or certificate.@en

While a CU in the Amber zone should be at a low risk of loss, there will be a degree of lost production. Decisions about the conservation of CUs in the Amber zone will involve broader consideration of biological, social, and economic issues. @en

Fisheries productivity results from individual fish completing their life cycle, and having vital rates (reproduction, growth, survival, etc.) that are sufficient to generate a sustainable yield at the population level. @en
