Amber zone,"Amber status implies caution in the management of the Conservation Unit. While a CU in the Amber zone should be at a low risk of loss, there will be a degree of lost production. Decisions about the conservation of CUs in the Amber zone will involve broader consideration of biological, social, and economic issues. ",Fisheries and Oceans Canada. (2021).
