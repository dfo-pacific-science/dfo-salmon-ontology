Wild Salmon Policy,"Canada's Policy for Conservation of Wild Pacific Salmon is a framework designed to restore and maintain healthy and diverse salmon populations and their habitats for the benefit of Canadians in perpetuity.

WSP integrated status,"Since CU status evaluations can include more than one metric, it is possible that different metrics could each indicate a different WSP status zone. A final step that synthesizes all metric and status-related information into an integrated status for each CU, and provides expert commentary on this information, is necessary as inputs into subsequent implementation of WSP Strategy 4 (Integrated Strategic Planning) to prioritize assessment activities and management actions .",DFO.

WSP rapid status,"The WSP rapid status assessment approach builds on previously completed WSP integrated status assessments. The detailed WSP integrated assessments are labour intensive, taking 10-40 experts up to three days to complete for each group of CUs. For this reason, assessments have only been completed for ~11% of the 377 current Pacific Salmon CUs, many of which are outdated. The WSP rapid approach can fill gaps by expanding coverage of CU statuses across time, species, and geographic areas. The WSP rapid status approach ensures statuses are scientifically objective, consistent, and comparable across BC/Yukon CUs. This approach is also relatively easy to implement, applicable to data rich and data poor CUs, and can be updated annually.","Pestal, G., MacDonald, B. L., Grant, S. C. H., and Holt, C. A. (2023).
