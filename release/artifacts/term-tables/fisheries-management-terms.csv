Limit reference point,"A fish stock experiencing serious harm may be depleted to the point where it has impaired productivity or reproductive capacity. As a result, the stock would be less resilient to fishing and could not easily rebuild. Serious harm may be irreversible, or only slowly reversible over the long-term, and can be due to fishing, other human-induced impacts, or natural causes. Under the Precautionary Approach policy and the Fish Stocks Provisions (FSPs), breaching the LRP is a trigger for a rebuilding plan.",Fisheries and Oceans Canada. (2024).
