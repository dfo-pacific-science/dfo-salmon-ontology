Limit reference point,"A fish stock experiencing serious harm may be depleted to the point where it has impaired productivity or reproductive capacity. As a result, the stock would be less resilient to fishing and could not easily rebuild. Serious harm may be irreversible, or only slowly reversible over the long-term, and can be due to fishing, other human-induced impacts, or natural causes. Under the Precautionary Approach policy and the Fish Stocks Provisions (FSPs), breaching the LRP is a trigger for a rebuilding plan.",Fisheries and Oceans Canada. (2024).

Upper stock reference,A threshold below which fishing must be reduced to avoid reaching the LRP. The USR must be set at an appropriate distance above the LRP to provide sufficient opportunity for managers to recognize a declining stock status and sufficient time for management actions to take effect. ,DFO Introduction to Stock Assessment Glossary.,DFO Introduction to Stock Assessment Glossary.,,Reference point (subClassOf) [https://w3id.org/gcdfos/salmon#ReferencePoint],https://w3id.org/gcdfos/salmon#UpperStockReferencePoint,https://w3id.org/gcdfos/salmon/widoco/index.html#UpperStockReferencePoint,696f78a84b4feb1ce5aa2db4e7a81826004adade,2025-12-08T05:01:23.559433+00:00,dfc15f2704a83e79eeeaed647b3734bf65ab2a3e895d9d55c3a3384f2dde8b3c
