Census by Manual Count at Fixed Site,Salmon are guided through a controlled opening in a fence/weir where trained observers visually tally each passage event on a continuous or daily schedule. Counting chambers/windows and SIL/SEN daily logs document coverage; bypass routes are monitored and closed where possible.,,,,Enumeration Method (broader) [https://w3id.org/gcdfo/salmon#EnumerationMethod]; Enumeration Method Scheme (inScheme) [https://w3id.org/gcdfo/salmon#EnumerationMethodScheme],https://w3id.org/gcdfo/salmon#CensusByManualCountAtFixedSite,https://w3id.org/gcdfo/salmon/widoco/index.html#CensusByManualCountAtFixedSite,16c2e13d2f5bcf6bb473fd168e2bca74daf206e0,2025-12-16T22:14:38.625018+00:00,4aa857cc80b640015644a0fcc9b923a2d191387d29c35d96655a7f18dbff6a59

Indicator river,"All spawning streams that are listed to be monitored by DFO are classified as an indicator or non-indicator stream. Indicator streams are those that have been identified in some Regions as providing more reliable indices of spawner abundance. Indicator streams tend to give relatively accurate annual spawner abundance estimates, given that they use higher quality methodologies and are more intensively/regularly surveyed. Indicator streams are also assumed to be representative of spawner returns to other streams in close geographic proximity. Non-indicator streams are typically less consistently surveyed, using more variable methodologies, and/or may simply be difficult to survey (e.g., poor water quality, remote location, etc.).",,,,lotic water body (subClassOf) [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000618],https://w3id.org/gcdfo/salmon#IndicatorRiver,https://w3id.org/gcdfo/salmon/widoco/index.html#IndicatorRiver,16c2e13d2f5bcf6bb473fd168e2bca74daf206e0,2025-12-16T22:14:38.625018+00:00,4aa857cc80b640015644a0fcc9b923a2d191387d29c35d96655a7f18dbff6a59
