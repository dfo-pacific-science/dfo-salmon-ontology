# ROBOT Custom Profile for DFO Salmon Ontology
# This profile adjusts violation levels for known acceptable issues

# Adjust violation levels for specific checks
checks:
  # SKOS concepts with skos:prefLabel don't need rdfs:label (W3C SKOS compliant)
  missing_label:
    level: INFO # Downgrade from ERROR to INFO

  # Hybrid OWL+SKOS concepts use skos:definition instead of rdfs:comment
  missing_definition:
    level: INFO # Downgrade from WARN to INFO


  # External imports (Darwin Core, BFO) don't need local definitions
  # This is handled by the missing_definition check above
# Exclude specific checks if needed
# exclude:
#   - some_other_check

# Add custom checks if needed
# custom:
#   - name: "custom_check_name"
#     query: "SELECT ... WHERE { ... }"
